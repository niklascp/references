abstract = {A number of studies have been initiated in the past to address the bus arrival time prediction problem. These efforts have resulted in three types of prediction models: (a) models based on historical data, (b) multilinear regression models, and (c) artificial neural network models. The first type of prediction models infers the current and future travel time of a bus based on the historical travel time of the same bus or other buses. Lin and Zeng (4) proposed a set of bus arrival time prediction algorithms for a transit traveler information system implemented in Blacksburg, Virginia. Four algorithms were intro-duced with different assumptions on input data and were shown to outperform several algorithms from the literature. Their algorithms, however, did not consider the effect of traffic congestion and dwell time at bus stations. Kidwell (5) presented an algorithm for predicting bus arrival times based on real-time vehicle location. The algorithm worked by dividing each route into zones and recording the time that each bus passed through each zone. Predictions were based on the most recent observation of a bus passing through each zone. However, this algorithm was not suitable for large cities where both travel time and dwell time could be subject to large variations. Generally speak-ing, these models are reliable only when the traffic pattern in the area of interest is relatively stable. One of their main limitations is that it requires an extensive set of historical data, which may not be available in practice, especially when the traffic pattern varies significantly over time. The second approach is applying mathematical models to predict the expected travel times between stops and then the expected bus arrival times at individual stops. These models are usually established by regressing travel times against a set of independent variables, such as traffic conditions, ridership, number of intermediate stops, and weather condition. Patnaik et al. (6) developed a set of regression models to estimate bus arrival times with data collected by automatic passenger counters installed on buses. The results obtained were promising and indicated that the developed models could be used to estimate bus arrival times under various conditions. However, this approach is reliable only when such equations can be established, which may not be possible for many application environments where many of the system variables are typically correlated. The third approach is applying artificial neural networks (ANN) that are capable of capturing complex nonlinear relationships. Jeong and Rilett (7) proposed an ANN model for predicting bus arrival times and demonstrated its superior performance as compared with other methods. However, ANN models require extensive training The ability to obtain accurate predictions of bus arrival time on a real-time basis is a vital element to both bus operations control and passenger information systems. Several studies had been devoted to this arrival time prediction problem; however, few resulted in completely satisfactory algorithms. This paper presents a new system that can be used to predict the expected bus arrival times at individual bus stops along a service route. The proposed prediction algorithm combines real-time location data from Global Positioning System receivers with average travel speeds of individual route segments, taking into account historical travel speed as well as temporal and spatial variations of traffic conditions. A geographic information system–based map-matching algorithm is used to project each received location onto the underlying transit network. The system is implemented as a finite state machine to ensure its regularity, stability, and robustness under a wide range of operating conditions. A case study on a real bus route is conducted to evaluate the performance of the pro-posed system in terms of prediction accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed system is capable of achieving satisfactory accuracy in pre-dicting bus arrival times and perfect performance in predicting travel direction. Accurate prediction of the expected arrival time of the next bus at individual bus stops is of significant value to both transit operators and users. With this arrival time information, transit operators can promptly respond to unexpected service interruptions and delays by introducing various bus control strategies, such as holding and stop-skipping (1). In the long term, transit operators could spot problematic routes and shifts that chronically run late and promptly take man-agerial and technical actions—such as training operators, adjusting schedules, and implementing transit signal priority—for improved performance. The overall quality of transit service could therefore be improved, which would ultimately make the public transporta-tion mode more user-friendly and attractive as compared with other transportation modes such as driving. Bus arrival time information can also be disseminated to travelers through various mediums such as electronic boards installed at bus stops, Internet, cable TV, and cellular phones (2, 3). Such information could reduce passengers' anxieties while waiting for buses and save them travel time because they can time their arrival at the bus stops more close to the schedule. Better information therefore helps retain},

@article{Weigel2007,
abstract = {The success of multi-model ensemble combination has been demonstrated in many studies. Given that a multi-model contains information from all participating models, including the less skilful ones, the question remains as to why, and under what conditions, a multi-model can outperform the best participating single model. It is the aim of this paper to resolve this apparent paradox. The study is based on a synthetic forecast generator, allowing the generation of perfectly-calibrated single-model ensembles of any size and skill. Additionally, the degree of ensemble under-dispersion (or overconfidence) can be prescribed. Multi-model ensembles are then constructed from both weighted and unweighted averages of these single-model ensembles. Applying this toy model, we carry out systematic model-combination experiments. We evaluate how multi-model performance depends on the skill and overconfidence of the participating single models. It turns out that multi-model ensembles can indeed locally outperform a ‘best-model' approach, but only if the single-model ensembles are overconfident. The reason is that multi-model combination reduces overconfidence, i.e. ensemble spread is widened while average ensemble-mean error is reduced. This implies a net gain in prediction skill, because probabilistic skill scores penalize overconfidence. Under these conditions, even the addition of an objectively-poor model can improve multi-model skill. It seems that simple ensemble inflation methods cannot yield the same skill improvement. Using seasonal near-surface temperature forecasts from the DEMETER dataset, we show that the conclusions drawn from the toy-model experiments hold equally in a real multi-model ensemble prediction system.

These systems send a stream of position annotated messages when requesting location based services. The position information in turn can be used to improve those services. Here, we focus on online map matching of the most recent position of a connected vehicle on a road map. This information, aggregated and privacy aware, can serve as a basis e.g. for machine learning algorithms used to improve traffic prediction. We describe a system for online map matching in the backend that implements a state of the art algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model. This system uses only open source software and open data. The development of the map matcher was motivated by a perceived lack of a scalable system in the open source realm. We discuss its role as part of a scalable backend system designed to provide spatially aware services.},

abstract = {Bus headway in a rural area usually is much larger than that in an urban area. Providing real-time bus arrival information could make the public transit system more user-friendly and thus enhance its competitiveness among various transportation modes. As part of an operational test for rural traveler information systems currently ongoing in Blacksburg, Virginia, an experimental study has been conducted on forecasting the arrival time of the next bus with automatic vehicle location techniques. The process of developing arrival time estimation algorithms is discussed, including route representation, global positioning system (GPS) data screening for identifying data quality and delay patterns, algorithm formulation, and development of measures of performance. Whereas GPS-based bus location data are adopted in all four algorithms presented, the extent to which other information is used in these algorithms varies. In addition to bus location data, information relevant to the performance of an algorithm includes scheduled arrival time, delay correlation, and waiting time at time-check stops. The performance of an algorithm using different levels of information is compared against three criteria: overall precision, robustness, and stability. Results show that at the site where the study is being conducted, the dwell time at time-check stops is most relevant to the performance of an algorithm.},

RDDs are motivated by two types of applications that current computing frameworks handle inefficiently: iterative algorithms and interactive data mining tools. In both cases, keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of magnitude. To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory, based on coarse-grained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs, such as Pregel, and new applications that these models do not capture. We have implemented RDDs in a system called Spark, which we evaluate through a variety of user applications and benchmarks.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Simulated climate dynamics, initialized with observed conditions, is expected to be synchronized, for several years, with the actual dynamics. However, the predictions of climate models are not sufficiently accurate. Moreover, there is a large variance between simulations initialized at different times and between different models. One way to improve climate predictions and to reduce the associated uncertainties is to use an ensemble of climate model predictions, weighted according to their past performances. Here, we show that skillful predictions, for a decadal time scale, of the 2 m temperature can be achieved by applying a sequential learning algorithm to an ensemble of decadal climate model simulations. The predictions generated by the learning algorithm are shown to be better than those of each of the models in the ensemble, the better performing simple average and a reference climatology. In addition, the uncertainties associated with the predictions are shown to be reduced relative to those derived from an equally weighted ensemble of bias-corrected predictions. The results show that learning algorithms can help to better assess future climate dynamics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While the focus has primarily been on the implementation of technologies, such as automatic vehicle-location systems, it is necessary to experiment and develop advanced performance analysis and evaluation procedures that can assist in schedule planning and real-time service-control tasks. One potentially useful and effective approach to these tasks is system behavior modeling. In this study this method is used to model schedule behavior of buses on a route using schedule-deviation information. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the application of artificial neural networks, which have been shown to hold promise then applied to nonlinear dynamic system-modeling problems, for developing schedule behavior models. Models are developed using the schedule-deviation information obtained from Tidewater Regional Transit's automatic vehicle-location system. The time-series analysis approach is adopted for the development of schedule behavior models at the route level. The results of a case study are encouraging and demonstrate the usefulness of artificial neural network techniques, especially the Jordan networks and the Elman networks, for modeling schedule deviations of buses on a route.},

For that reason, these models are not able to imitate motorcyclists' behavior well. This paper proposes a maneuverability model framework for motorcycles in queues at signalized intersections with considering the dynamic motorcycle's lane. The model includes (i) a dynamic motorcycle's lane to identify the current, left, and right lanes of the subject motorcycle, (ii) a threshold distance to determine when a motorcyclist starts to consider maneuvering, (iii) a lane selection model to identify the lane preferred by a motorcyclist, and (iv) a gap acceptance model to describe whether or not the lead and lag gaps are acceptable for maneuvering. The model framework captures the variation across the motorcyclist population and over time observations. The models were applied to Hanoi and Hochiminh city, Vietnam, based on microscopic data collected from video images. All of the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with the statistical estimation software GAUSS. The results show that 77.88{\%} of the observed maneuvers – either staying in the current lane or turning left or right – could be modeled correctly by the proposed models.},

abstract = {In this paper, the concept of using bus probes for urban street travel time estimation in the advanced traveler information system (ATIS) application is investigated through both a thorough literature review and a case study in downtown Chicago using the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)'s buses. First, existing bus probes studies are reviewed and compared with respect to the research objectives, facility type, data source, modeling technique, and key research findings. The literature supports the concept of bus probes to ATIS applications. However, the past studies have focused on highways (freeways and principal arterials) and used what is called archived automatic vehicle location (AVL) bus data, which are not suitable for real time forecasting (online updating). The case study presented in the second part of the paper is the first of its kind that uses real-time bus tracking data for urban signalized street travel time estimation. Multivariate time series state-space modeling techniques are applied. The case study finds significant interrelation between bus and car speeds. In particular, stronger influence of car operations (in terms of speed) is found on bus operations in the traffic stream than buses on cars. These findings indicate that AVL buses are plausible probes for urban street ATIS. This conclusion, however, must be understood within the study limitations discussed at the end of the paper.},

This foundation rests on the Wold decomposition theorem and on the assertion that a one-week lagged first seasonal difference applied to discrete interval traffic condition data will yield a weakly stationary transformation. Moreover, empirical results using actual intelligent transportation system data are presented and found to be consistent with the theoretical hypothesis. Conclusions are given on the implications of these assertions and findings relative to ongoing intelligent transportation systems research, deployment, and operations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {The maneuvering models of motorcycles in previous studies often considered motorcycles' traveling in terms of movements in a physical static lane and not in terms of dynamic virtual lane-based movements. For that reason, these models are not able to imitate motorcyclists' behavior well. This paper proposes a maneuverability model framework for motorcycles in queues at signalized intersections with considering the dynamic motorcycle's lane. The model includes (i) a dynamic motorcycle's lane to identify the current, left, and right lanes of the subject motorcycle, (ii) a threshold distance to determine when a motorcyclist starts to consider maneuvering, (iii) a lane selection model to identify the lane preferred by a motorcyclist, and (iv) a gap acceptance model to describe whether or not the lead and lag gaps are acceptable for maneuvering. The model framework captures the variation across the motorcyclist population and over time observations. The models were applied to Hanoi and Hochiminh city, Vietnam, based on microscopic data collected from video images. All of the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with the statistical estimation software GAUSS. The results show that 77.88{\%} of the observed maneuvers – either staying in the current lane or turning left or right – could be modeled correctly by the proposed models.},

abstract = {Efficiently and effectively run public transit systems are essential components of and crucial contributors to the proper functioning of a region's overall transportation network. However, travel by public transit is a complex process that involves more than simply people moving about on buses and trains. A typical door-to-door trip involves walking from one's origin to a bus stop or train station, waiting for a vehicle to arrive, boarding the vehicle, traveling in the vehicle, alighting from the vehicle, and then walking to one's final destination. In many cases, the trip also involves transfers; travelers alight from one transit vehicle, move to a new stop or platform, wait for another transit vehicle, board that vehicle and continue this process until they reach their last stop or station at which time they then must walk to their final destination. Therefore, transit travelers expend a great deal of their time, energy, and patience outside of buses and trains, and this contributes greatly to both their actual and perceived burden of transit travel. This added burden influences the travelers' decisions on whether or not to take transit in the future. Given the relative convenience of door-to-door travel by foot, bicycle, taxi, or private vehicle for many trips, public transit systems are often at a competitive disadvantage when competing for passengers. This research examines ways to increase the attractiveness of public transportation and reduce the perceived burden of the time spent outside of vehicles during transit trips.},

abstract = {A vast majority of urban transportation systems in North America are equipped with traffic surveillance systems that provide real time traffic information to traffic management centers. The information from these are processed and provided back to the travelers in real time. However, the travelers are interested to know not only the current traffic information, but also the future traffic conditions predicted based on the real time data. These predicted values inform the drivers on what they can expect when they make the trip. Travel time is one of the most popular variables which the users are interested to know. Travelers make decisions to bypass congested segments of the network, to change departure time or destination etc., based on this information. Hence it is important that the predicted values be as accurate as possible. A number of different forecasting methods have been proposed for travel time forecasting including historic method, real-time method, time series analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANN). This paper examines the use of a machine learning technique, namely support vector machines (SVM), for the short-term prediction of travel time. While other machine learning techniques, such as ANN, have been extensively studied, the reported applications of SVM in the field of transportation engineering are very few. A comparison of the performance of SVM with ANN, real time, and historic approach is carried out. Data from the TransGuide Traffic Management center in San Antonio, Texas, USA is used for the analysis. From the results it was found that SVM is a viable alternative for short-term prediction problems when the amount of data is less or noisy in nature. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Reliability of public transport systems has been considered critically important by public$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntransport users, operators and the government. Lack of reliability in public transport results in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nuncertainty and delays aggravating anxiety and discomfort for the passengers and increases$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncosts due to lost mileage and lower fleet utilisation for the operators. The government$\backslash$r$\backslash$nemphasises a reliable bus-service in order to ensure its competitiveness to car use such that$\backslash$r$\backslash$nit results in modal shift. Though reliability is of significance to a range of actors such as the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbus operators and the passengers, its interpretations vary across different groups. For$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexample, quality of service identified by the demand-oriented indicators, the travellers, is$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsystematically different from what the supply-based quality indicators show. Reliability, as a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmeasure of quality of service, is related to the operational characteristics of the public$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntransport system. Passenger's wait time, on the other hand, is much more sensitive to$\backslash$r$\backslash$nschedule reliability than to service frequency.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis paper investigates some of the measures used to assess reliability of an urban bus$\backslash$r$\backslash$nnetwork using a dynamic microsimulation model framework. The framework incorporates$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmodels of bus operation, passenger arrival and boarding for buses within a network model of$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngeneral traffic. It therefore allows explicit modelling of the interactions among cars, buses$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand passengers and of their effect on bus reliability. The model framework is applied to a$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncase study based on a bus route in the city of York. Empirical analysis of the test route was$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncarried out to understand the background of reliability issues and to establish a sound base$\backslash$r$\backslash$nscenario of the network. The simulation model is used to help understand the causes and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprocess of occurrence of unreliability and to study the impacts of possible scenarios such as$\backslash$r$\backslash$nincreased congestion, rise in passenger demand, and reduction in ‘per passenger boarding$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntime' on the reliability of the test-route. The study measures reliability in terms of travel time,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nheadways and excess passenger wait time, and sheds light on factors affecting them.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe results of the study reveal that excess passenger wait time is strongly correlated with the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nvariation of headways and an increase in passenger demand intensifies the ‘bunching and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nspreading out' of buses. With increasing congestion and passenger demand, reliability is$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreduced. Reduction in per passenger boarding time proves to be an effective measure in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimproving reliability.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nBeyond these specific case study results, the modelling framework developed may serve as$\backslash$r$\backslash$na useful tool to assess reliability levels for a future year and to evaluate proposed strategies$\backslash$r$\backslash$nto improve reliability before implementation. Such a modelling framework, if extended to$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncover larger bus networks can serve as an important decision-making tool in the hands of the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngovernment and bus operators for offering more reliable bus services to the public.},

abstract = {Effective prediction of travel times is central to many advanced traveler information and transportation management systems. In this paper we propose a method to predict freeway travel times using a linear model in which the coefficients vary as smooth functions of the departure time. The method is straightforward to implement, computationally efficient and applicable to widely available freeway sensor data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying the method to two real-life loop detector data sets. The first data set-on I-880-is relatively small in scale, but very high in quality, containing information from probe vehicles and double loop detectors. On this data set the prediction error ranges from 5{\%} for a trip leaving immediately to 10{\%} for a trip leaving 30 min or more in the future. Having obtained encouraging results from the small data set, we move on to apply the method to a data set on a much larger spatial scale, from Caltrans District 12 in Los Angeles. On this data set, our errors range from about 8{\%} at zero lag to 13{\%} at a time lag of 30 min or more. We also investigate several extensions to the original method in the context of this larger data set. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we describe an efficient non-parametric algorithm which provides highly accurate predictions based on real-time GPS measurements. The key idea is to use a Kernel Regression model to represent the dependencies between position updates and the arrival times at bus stops. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on real data from the public bus transportation system in Dublin, Ireland. For a time horizon of 50 minutes, the prediction error of the algorithm is less than 10 percent on average. It clearly outperforms parametric methods which use a Linear Regression model, predictions based on the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, and a system which computes predictions of arrival times based on the current delay of buses. A study investigating the selection of interpolation points to reduce the size of the training set concludes the paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Several decades of research on transit pricing have provided clear insights into how riders respond to price changes in both the transit and automobile sectors. For the most part, riders are insensitive to changes in either fare levels, structures, or forms of payments, though this varies considerably among user groups and operating environments. Since riders are approximately twice as sensitive to changes in travel time as they are to changes in fares, a compelling argument can be made for operating more premium quality transit services at higher prices. Such programs could be supplemented by vouchers and concessionary programs to reduce the burden of higher fares on love-income users. Also, cross-elasticity research suggests that higher automobile prices would have a significantly greater affect on ridership than lower fares. Most research on transit fare structures shows that the common practice of fiat fares is highly inequitable, penalizing short-distance and off-peak users. Free fare programs have proven quite costly for each new' transit user attracted and have rarely lured motorists to transit. Free fares limited to downtowns have been more successful than systemwide free fare programs. While prepayment schemes have met with success in the U.S. and Europe, honor fares h{\~{}},ve suffered from excessive revenue losses in at least one case in the U.S, Some of the more noteworthy fare policy successes in North America have been Bridgeport's combined pass-fare program, Allentown's deep discounts, Ottawa's major fare reduction and differentiation, and Columbus's substantial midday discount. As paratransit and other new transit alternatives to conventional bus continue to emerge, new, more differentiated fare practices can be expected in the future.},

In the proposed model, the well-trained SVM model predicts the baseline bus travel times from the historical bus trip data; the Kalman filtering-based dynamic algorithm can adjust bus travel times with the latest bus operation information and the estimated baseline travel times. The performance of the proposed dynamic model is validated with the real-world data on road with multiple bus routes in Shenzhen, China.

abstract = {Public transport operators aim to provide higher levels of reliability for their users because reliable services are more attractive, and can also reduce operating costs for the agency. This work addresses the issue in a context where high-quality public transport is the norm. An on- going study makes use of Automatic Vehicle Location data (AVL) of bus Line 31 in Zurich to estimate quantitative operational reliability measures. A number of in-vehicle observations during peak periods, and aggregate operational data reports complement the detailed AVL data. The main objective is to shed light on the major causes of reliability problems in Line 31 by first identifying where the problems are located and how performance varies throughout the day. Initial results indicate that intersections contribute most to delays, even with the presence of active priority for vehicles at traffic lights. In Zurich, high reliability levels are achieved with a limited level of segregation and exclusive lanes. Together with priority measures, holding strategies and timetables with sufficient recovery times are considered to contribute most to a stable operation. It is not expected that reliability can be significantly improved without a higher degree of segregation from the rest of the traffic. The results of this work provide a quantitative benchmark to which further improvements in the service can be compared. It can also prove useful to cities looking for ways to improve the reliability of their urban bus services. Further work will deal with the analysis of timetable design, buffer time allocation and holding strategies.},

The Weka library implementations of the latter three classifiers are utilized on bus travel time prediction in Trondheim, Norway. A brief overview of the data collection process and a rationale for selecting the data sources is given. Next, the parameters of the classifiers are optimized, and different partitions of training and test periods are evaluated. An attribute analysis investigates the use of other variables hypothesized to influence travel time prediction, such as weather, to improve the prediction accuracy. Finally, a proof of concept model for real-time prediction is presented, with its performance being competitive to the existing real-time system.},

The purpose of this research is to develop and compare dynamic travel time prediction models which can provide accurate prediction of bus travel time in order to give real-time information at a given downstream bus stop using only global positioning system (GPS) data. Historical Average (HA), Kalman Filtering (KF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are considered and developed in this paper. A case has been studied by making use of the three models. Promising results are obtained from the case study, indicating that the models can be used to implement an Advanced Public Transport System. The implementation of this system could assist transit operators in improving the reliability of bus services, thus attracting more travelers to transit vehicles and helping relieve congestion. The performances of the three models were assessed and compared with each other under two criteria: overall prediction accuracy and robustness. It was shown that the ANN outperformed the other two models in both aspects. In conclusion, it is shown that bus travel time information can be reasonably provided using only arrival and departure time information at stops even in the absence of traffic-stream data.},

This paper presents a hybrid prediction scheme to generate real-time information concerning downstream vehicle trajectories and next bus arrival. The prediction generated by the proposed hybrid scheme integrates three travel time components: schedule, instantaneous and historical data. Genetic algorithm is applied in order to specify the contribution of each data source component to the prediction scheme. The benefits, transferability and estimation form of the proposed scheme were tested by applying it on three trunk bus lines in Stockholm, Sweden. Its performance was compared to a commonly deployed scheme. The results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces significantly the overall mean absolute error for all routes from both operators' and passengers' perspectives.},

This paper proposes models to predict bus arrival times at the same bus stop but with different routes. In the proposed models, bus running times of multiple routes are used for predicting the bus arrival time of each of these bus routes. Several methods, which include support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), k nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) and linear regression (LR), are adopted for the bus arrival time prediction. Observation surveys are conducted to collect bus running and arrival time data for validation of the proposed models. The results show that the proposed models are more accurate than the models based on the bus running times of single route. Moreover, it is found that the SVM model performs the best among the four proposed models for predicting the bus arrival times at bus stop with multiple routes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Short-term passenger demand forecasting is of great importance to the on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependences, temporal dependences, and exogenous dependences need to be considered simultaneously, however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependences within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection. The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China. Experimental results, validated on real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing, show that the FCL-Net achieves better predictive performance than traditional approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and neural network based algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network and LSTM). This paper is one of the first DL studies to forecast the short-term passenger demand of an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal correlations.},

abstract = {In recent years, several transit agencies have been trying to be more competitive with the automobile to attract choice riders. Transit agencies can only be competitive if they can provide services that are reliable, have a short access and egress time, and have run times that are comparable to automobiles. Several transit agencies try to be competitive through offering faster service, such as limited-stop (express) bus service. This study uses AVL and APC data, in addition to a disaggregate data obtained from a travel behavior survey, to select stops and estimate run times for a new limited-stop service that will run parallel to a heavily used bus route (67 Saint-Michel) in Montr??al, Canada. Three different scenarios are developed based on theory and practice to select stops to be incorporated in the new limited service. The time savings for each scenario are then evaluated as a range and a fourth scenario is developed. A limited-stop service is recommended based on selecting stops serving both directions of the route, major activity points and stop spacing. This study shows that implementing a limited-stop service would yield substantial time savings for both, the new limited service and the existing regular service running in parallel. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Transport investments normally reduce travel times, but may also reduce unreliability. Conventional time gains can be evaluated in cost benefit analysis using standard values of time. For valuing reliability gains, however, no standard measures are readily available. The Dutch Ministry of Transport has commissioned a project to design a Stated Preference methodology. Reliability is a complex “academic” concept and it may be difficult to present and explain it to respondents. Therefore, a pilot study using in-depth face-to-face interviews has been carried out, in which various SP choice designs have been presented to the participants to test their understanding of the questions. In the end, we found a “best” design. But still, much care is needed for an acceptable response rate and to prevent illogical and inconsistent responses.},

abstract = {The emphasis of this research effort was on using AVL and APC dynamic data to develop a bus travel time model capable of providing real-time information on bus arrival and departure times to passengers (via traveler information services) and to transit controllers for the application of proactive control strategies. The developed model is comprised of two Kalman filter algorithms for the prediction of running times and dwell times alternately in an integrated framework. The AVL and APC data used were obtained for a specific bus route in Downtown Toronto. The perfor-mance of the developed prediction model was tested using " hold out " data and other data from a microsimulation model representing different scenarios of bus opera-tion along the investigated route using the VISSIM microsimulation software pack-age. The Kalman filter-based model outperformed other conventional models in terms of accuracy, demonstrating the dynamic ability to update itself based on new data that reflected the changing characteristics of the transit-operating environ-ment. A user-interactive system was developed to provide continuous information on the expected arrival and departure times of buses at downstream stops, hence the ex-pected deviations from schedule. The system enables the user to assess in real time},

abstract = {Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) are one component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and a major component of ATIS is travel time information. Automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems, which are a part of ITS, have been adopted by many transit agencies to track their vehicles and to predict travel time in real time. Because of the complexity involved, there is no universally adopted approach for this latter application, and research is needed in this area. The objectives of the research in this paper are to develop a model to predict bus arrival time using AVL data and apply the model for real-time applications. The test bed was a bus route located in Houston, Texas, and the travel time prediction model considered schedule adherence, traffic congestion, and dwell times. A historical data-based model, regression models, and artificial neural network (ANN) models were used to predict bus arrival time. It was found that ANN models outperformed both the historical data-based model and t...},

@article{Gal2017,
abstract = {Urban mobility impacts urban life to a great extent. To enhance urban mobility, much research was invested in traveling time prediction: given an origin and destination, provide a passenger with an accurate estimation of how long a journey lasts. In this work, we investigate a novel combination of methods from Queueing Theory and Machine Learning in the prediction process. We propose a prediction engine that, given a scheduled bus journey (route) and a 'source/destination' pair, provides an estimate for the traveling time, while considering both historical data and real-time streams of information that are transmitted by buses. We propose a model that uses natural segmentation of the data according to bus stops and a set of predictors, some use learning while others are learning-free, to compute traveling time. Our empirical evaluation, using bus data that comes from the bus network in the city of Dublin, demonstrates that the snapshot principle, taken from Queueing Theory, works well yet suffers from outliers. To overcome the outliers problem, we use Machine Learning techniques as a regulator that assists in identifying outliers and propose prediction based on historical data.},

abstract = {In biomedical data, the imbalanced data problem occurs frequently and causes poor prediction performance for minority classes. It is because the trained classifiers are mostly derived from the majority class. In this paper, we describe an ensemble learning method combined with active example selection to resolve the imbalanced data problem. Our method consists of three key components: 1) an active example selection algorithm to choose informative examples for training the classifier, 2) an ensemble learning method to combine variations of classifiers derived by active example selection, and 3) an incremental learning scheme to speed up the iterative training procedure for active example selection. We evaluate the method on six real-world imbalanced data sets in biomedical domains, showing that the proposed method outperforms both the random under sampling and the ensemble with under sampling methods. Compared to other approaches to solving the imbalanced data problem, our method excels by 0.03-0.15 points in AUC measure.},
