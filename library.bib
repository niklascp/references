abstract = {As congestion worsens, the importance of rigorous methodologies to estimate travel-time reliability increases. Exploiting fine-granularity transit global positioning system (GPS) data, this research proposes a novel method to estimate travel-time percentiles and confidence intervals. Novel transit reliability measures based on travel-time percentiles are proposed to identify and rank low-performance hotspots; the proposed reliability measures can be utilized to distinguish peak-hour low performance from whole-day low performance. As a case study, the methodology is applied to a bus transit corridor in Portland, Oregon. Time-space speed profiles, heatmaps, and visualizations are employed to highlight sections and intersections with high travel-time variability and transit low performance. Segment and intersection travel-time reliability are contrasted against analytical delay formulas at intersections with positive results. If bus stop delays are removed, this methodology can also be applied to estimate regular traffic travel-time variability.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering. All rights reserved. Traffic flow data are stochastic in nature, and an abundance of literature exists thereof. One way to express stochastic data is the Langevin equation. Langevin equation consists of two parts. The first part is known as the deterministic drift term, the other as the stochastic diffusion term. Langevin equation does not only help derive the deterministic and random terms of the selected portion of the city of Istanbul traffic empirically, but also sheds light on the underlying dynamics of the flow. Drift diagrams have shown that slow lane tends to get congested faster when vehicle speeds attain a value of 25 km/h, and it is 20 km/h for the fast lane. Three or four distinct regimes may be discriminated again from the drift diagrams; congested, intermediate, and free-flow regimes. At places, even the intermediate regime may be divided in two, often with readiness to congestion. This has revealed the fact that for the selected portion of the highway, there are two main states of flow, namely, congestion and free-flow, with an intermediate state where the noise-driven traffic flow forces the flow into either of the distinct regimes.},

abstract = {Effective prediction of travel times is central to many advanced traveler information and transportation management systems. In this paper we propose a method to predict freeway travel times using a linear model in which the coefficients vary as smooth functions of the departure time. The method is straightforward to implement, computationally efficient and applicable to widely available freeway sensor data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying the method to two real-life loop detector data sets. The first data set-on I-880-is relatively small in scale, but very high in quality, containing information from probe vehicles and double loop detectors. On this data set the prediction error ranges from 5{\%} for a trip leaving immediately to 10{\%} for a trip leaving 30 min or more in the future. Having obtained encouraging results from the small data set, we move on to apply the method to a data set on a much larger spatial scale, from Caltrans District 12 in Los Angeles. On this data set, our errors range from about 8{\%} at zero lag to 13{\%} at a time lag of 30 min or more. We also investigate several extensions to the original method in the context of this larger data set. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The objective of this research is to develop a dynamic model that can provide accurate prediction for the Estimated Time of Arrival of a bus at a given bus stop using global positioning system (GPS) data which is collected in Macae, Brazil. The provision of timely and accurate travel time information of transit vehicles is valuable for both operators and passengers. It helps operators to monitor and manage their fleets in real time. It also allows passengers to plan their trips to minimize waiting times. Here, an artificial neural network (ANN) is developed for prediction due to its ability to solve complex non-linear relationships. The results obtained from the overall study are promising and the proposed ANN model can be used to implement an Advanced Public Transport System . The implementation of this system will improve the reliability of the public transport system, thus attracting more travelers to transit vehicles and helping relieve congestion. The performance of the proposed ANN model was compared with a historical average model under two criteria: overall precision and robustness. It was shown that the ANN outperformed the average approach.},

abstract = {Timely accurate traffic forecast is crucial for urban traffic control and guidance. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of mid-and-long term prediction tasks and often neglect spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN), to tackle the time series prediction problem in traffic domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete convolutional structures, which enable much faster training speed with fewer parameters. Experiments show that our model STGCN effectively captures comprehensive spatio-temporal correlations through modeling multi-scale traffic networks and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world traffic datasets.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t On high-frequency routes, transit agencies hold buses at control points and seek to dispatch them with even headways to avoid bus bunching. This paper compares holding methods used in practice and recommended in the literature using simulated and historical data from Tri-Met route 72 in Portland, Oregon. We evaluated the performance of each holding method in terms of headway instability and mean holding time. We tested the sensitivity of holding methods to their parameterization and to the number of control points. We found that Schedule-Based methods require little holding time but are unable to stabilize headways even when applied at a high control point density. The Headway-Based methods are able to successfully control headways but they require long holding times. Prediction-Based methods achieve the best compromise between headway regularity and holding time on a wide range of desired trade-offs. Finally, we found the prediction-based methods to be sen-sitive to prediction accuracy, but using an existing prediction method we were able to min-imize this sensitivity. These results can be used to inform the decision of transit agencies to implement holding methods on routes similar to TriMet 72. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Weigel2007,
abstract = {The success of multi-model ensemble combination has been demonstrated in many studies. Given that a multi-model contains information from all participating models, including the less skilful ones, the question remains as to why, and under what conditions, a multi-model can outperform the best participating single model. It is the aim of this paper to resolve this apparent paradox. The study is based on a synthetic forecast generator, allowing the generation of perfectly-calibrated single-model ensembles of any size and skill. Additionally, the degree of ensemble under-dispersion (or overconfidence) can be prescribed. Multi-model ensembles are then constructed from both weighted and unweighted averages of these single-model ensembles. Applying this toy model, we carry out systematic model-combination experiments. We evaluate how multi-model performance depends on the skill and overconfidence of the participating single models. It turns out that multi-model ensembles can indeed locally outperform a ‘best-model' approach, but only if the single-model ensembles are overconfident. The reason is that multi-model combination reduces overconfidence, i.e. ensemble spread is widened while average ensemble-mean error is reduced. This implies a net gain in prediction skill, because probabilistic skill scores penalize overconfidence. Under these conditions, even the addition of an objectively-poor model can improve multi-model skill. It seems that simple ensemble inflation methods cannot yield the same skill improvement. Using seasonal near-surface temperature forecasts from the DEMETER dataset, we show that the conclusions drawn from the toy-model experiments hold equally in a real multi-model ensemble prediction system.

abstract = {A number of studies have been initiated in the past to address the bus arrival time prediction problem. These efforts have resulted in three types of prediction models: (a) models based on historical data, (b) multilinear regression models, and (c) artificial neural network models. The first type of prediction models infers the current and future travel time of a bus based on the historical travel time of the same bus or other buses. Lin and Zeng (4) proposed a set of bus arrival time prediction algorithms for a transit traveler information system implemented in Blacksburg, Virginia. Four algorithms were intro-duced with different assumptions on input data and were shown to outperform several algorithms from the literature. Their algorithms, however, did not consider the effect of traffic congestion and dwell time at bus stations. Kidwell (5) presented an algorithm for predicting bus arrival times based on real-time vehicle location. The algorithm worked by dividing each route into zones and recording the time that each bus passed through each zone. Predictions were based on the most recent observation of a bus passing through each zone. However, this algorithm was not suitable for large cities where both travel time and dwell time could be subject to large variations. Generally speak-ing, these models are reliable only when the traffic pattern in the area of interest is relatively stable. One of their main limitations is that it requires an extensive set of historical data, which may not be available in practice, especially when the traffic pattern varies significantly over time. The second approach is applying mathematical models to predict the expected travel times between stops and then the expected bus arrival times at individual stops. These models are usually established by regressing travel times against a set of independent variables, such as traffic conditions, ridership, number of intermediate stops, and weather condition. Patnaik et al. (6) developed a set of regression models to estimate bus arrival times with data collected by automatic passenger counters installed on buses. The results obtained were promising and indicated that the developed models could be used to estimate bus arrival times under various conditions. However, this approach is reliable only when such equations can be established, which may not be possible for many application environments where many of the system variables are typically correlated. The third approach is applying artificial neural networks (ANN) that are capable of capturing complex nonlinear relationships. Jeong and Rilett (7) proposed an ANN model for predicting bus arrival times and demonstrated its superior performance as compared with other methods. However, ANN models require extensive training The ability to obtain accurate predictions of bus arrival time on a real-time basis is a vital element to both bus operations control and passenger information systems. Several studies had been devoted to this arrival time prediction problem; however, few resulted in completely satisfactory algorithms. This paper presents a new system that can be used to predict the expected bus arrival times at individual bus stops along a service route. The proposed prediction algorithm combines real-time location data from Global Positioning System receivers with average travel speeds of individual route segments, taking into account historical travel speed as well as temporal and spatial variations of traffic conditions. A geographic information system–based map-matching algorithm is used to project each received location onto the underlying transit network. The system is implemented as a finite state machine to ensure its regularity, stability, and robustness under a wide range of operating conditions. A case study on a real bus route is conducted to evaluate the performance of the pro-posed system in terms of prediction accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed system is capable of achieving satisfactory accuracy in pre-dicting bus arrival times and perfect performance in predicting travel direction. Accurate prediction of the expected arrival time of the next bus at individual bus stops is of significant value to both transit operators and users. With this arrival time information, transit operators can promptly respond to unexpected service interruptions and delays by introducing various bus control strategies, such as holding and stop-skipping (1). In the long term, transit operators could spot problematic routes and shifts that chronically run late and promptly take man-agerial and technical actions—such as training operators, adjusting schedules, and implementing transit signal priority—for improved performance. The overall quality of transit service could therefore be improved, which would ultimately make the public transporta-tion mode more user-friendly and attractive as compared with other transportation modes such as driving. Bus arrival time information can also be disseminated to travelers through various mediums such as electronic boards installed at bus stops, Internet, cable TV, and cellular phones (2, 3). Such information could reduce passengers' anxieties while waiting for buses and save them travel time because they can time their arrival at the bus stops more close to the schedule. Better information therefore helps retain},

abstract = {Urban travel time estimation is of significant importance at many levels of traffic operation and transportation management. This paper develops a tensor-based context-aware approach to dynamically provide personalized travel time estimation from a citywide perspective, using sparse and large-scale GPS trajectories. This novel model is comprised of four major components: map matching, travel time tensor construction, context-aware feature extraction, and travel time tensor factorization. First, GPS trajectories are map-matched onto the road network. Then, travel times of different drivers on different road segments in different time slots are modeled with a 3-order tensor. Following these, three categories of context features, i.e., historical, geographical and spatial-temporal features, are extracted to capture the contextual information of travel time and traffic condition in the road network. Finally, an objective function is devised to factorize travel time tensors with context features collaboratively. In addition, a gradient-based algorithm is developed to find an optimal solution for the context-aware estimation model. The novel model incorporates both the spatial correlation between different road segments and the deviation between different drivers, as well as the fine-grain temporal correlation between different time slots and the coarse-grain temporal correlation between recent and historical traffic conditions. The proposed model is applied in a real case on the urban road network of Beijing, China, based on the sparse and large-scale GPS trajectories collected from over 32,000 drivers in a period of 2 months. Empirical results on extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model provides an effective and robust approach for citywide personalized travel time estimation, and outperforms the competing methods.},

abstract = {Reliability of public transport systems has been considered critically important by public$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntransport users, operators and the government. Lack of reliability in public transport results in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nuncertainty and delays aggravating anxiety and discomfort for the passengers and increases$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncosts due to lost mileage and lower fleet utilisation for the operators. The government$\backslash$r$\backslash$nemphasises a reliable bus-service in order to ensure its competitiveness to car use such that$\backslash$r$\backslash$nit results in modal shift. Though reliability is of significance to a range of actors such as the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbus operators and the passengers, its interpretations vary across different groups. For$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexample, quality of service identified by the demand-oriented indicators, the travellers, is$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsystematically different from what the supply-based quality indicators show. Reliability, as a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmeasure of quality of service, is related to the operational characteristics of the public$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntransport system. Passenger's wait time, on the other hand, is much more sensitive to$\backslash$r$\backslash$nschedule reliability than to service frequency.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis paper investigates some of the measures used to assess reliability of an urban bus$\backslash$r$\backslash$nnetwork using a dynamic microsimulation model framework. The framework incorporates$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmodels of bus operation, passenger arrival and boarding for buses within a network model of$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngeneral traffic. It therefore allows explicit modelling of the interactions among cars, buses$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand passengers and of their effect on bus reliability. The model framework is applied to a$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncase study based on a bus route in the city of York. Empirical analysis of the test route was$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncarried out to understand the background of reliability issues and to establish a sound base$\backslash$r$\backslash$nscenario of the network. The simulation model is used to help understand the causes and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprocess of occurrence of unreliability and to study the impacts of possible scenarios such as$\backslash$r$\backslash$nincreased congestion, rise in passenger demand, and reduction in ‘per passenger boarding$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntime' on the reliability of the test-route. The study measures reliability in terms of travel time,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nheadways and excess passenger wait time, and sheds light on factors affecting them.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe results of the study reveal that excess passenger wait time is strongly correlated with the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nvariation of headways and an increase in passenger demand intensifies the ‘bunching and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nspreading out' of buses. With increasing congestion and passenger demand, reliability is$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreduced. Reduction in per passenger boarding time proves to be an effective measure in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimproving reliability.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nBeyond these specific case study results, the modelling framework developed may serve as$\backslash$r$\backslash$na useful tool to assess reliability levels for a future year and to evaluate proposed strategies$\backslash$r$\backslash$nto improve reliability before implementation. Such a modelling framework, if extended to$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncover larger bus networks can serve as an important decision-making tool in the hands of the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngovernment and bus operators for offering more reliable bus services to the public.},

This work is a continuation of a state-of-the-art review identifying four prominent machine learning algorithms used for bus arrival prediction: Kalman filtering, k-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Regression. The Weka library implementations of the latter three classifiers are utilized on bus travel time prediction in Trondheim, Norway. A brief overview of the data collection process and a rationale for selecting the data sources is given. Next, the parameters of the classifiers are optimized, and different partitions of training and test periods are evaluated. An attribute analysis investigates the use of other variables hypothesized to influence travel time prediction, such as weather, to improve the prediction accuracy. Finally, a proof of concept model for real-time prediction is presented, with its performance being competitive to the existing real-time system.},

abstract = {In this paper, the concept of using bus probes for urban street travel time estimation in the advanced traveler information system (ATIS) application is investigated through both a thorough literature review and a case study in downtown Chicago using the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)'s buses. First, existing bus probes studies are reviewed and compared with respect to the research objectives, facility type, data source, modeling technique, and key research findings. The literature supports the concept of bus probes to ATIS applications. However, the past studies have focused on highways (freeways and principal arterials) and used what is called archived automatic vehicle location (AVL) bus data, which are not suitable for real time forecasting (online updating). The case study presented in the second part of the paper is the first of its kind that uses real-time bus tracking data for urban signalized street travel time estimation. Multivariate time series state-space modeling techniques are applied. The case study finds significant interrelation between bus and car speeds. In particular, stronger influence of car operations (in terms of speed) is found on bus operations in the traffic stream than buses on cars. These findings indicate that AVL buses are plausible probes for urban street ATIS. This conclusion, however, must be understood within the study limitations discussed at the end of the paper.},

Providing passengers with accurate bus arrival information through Advanced Trav- eler Information Systems can assist passengers' decision-making (e.g., postpone de- parture time from home) and reduce average waiting time. This article develops a set of regression models that estimate arrival times for buses traveling between two points along a route. The data applied for developing the proposed model were collected by Automatic Passenger Counters installed on buses operated by a transit agency in the northeast region of the United States. The results obtained are promis- ing, and indicate that the developed models could be used to estimate bus arrival times under various conditions},

@article{BatchNorm,
abstract = {{Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch{\}}. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {Neural networks have been extensively applied to short-term traffic prediction in the past years. This study proposes a novel architecture of neural networks, Long Short-Term Neural Network (LSTM NN), to capture nonlinear traffic dynamic in an effective manner. The LSTM NN can overcome the issue of back-propagated error decay through memory blocks, and thus exhibits the superior capability for time series prediction with long temporal dependency. In addition, the LSTM NN can automatically determine the optimal time lags. To validate the effectiveness of LSTM NN, travel speed data from traffic microwave detectors in Beijing are used for model training and testing. A comparison with different topologies of dynamic neural networks as well as other prevailing parametric and nonparametric algorithms suggests that LSTM NN can achieve the best prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and stability.},

RDDs are motivated by two types of applications that current computing frameworks handle inefficiently: iterative algorithms and interactive data mining tools. In both cases, keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of magnitude. To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory, based on coarse-grained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs, such as Pregel, and new applications that these models do not capture. We have implemented RDDs in a system called Spark, which we evaluate through a variety of user applications and benchmarks.},

abstract = {The establishment of the Advanced Public Transportation Systems program has encouraged bus transit operators to experiment with implementing automatic vehicle-location systems for real-time monitoring and supervision of operations. While the focus has primarily been on the implementation of technologies, such as automatic vehicle-location systems, it is necessary to experiment and develop advanced performance analysis and evaluation procedures that can assist in schedule planning and real-time service-control tasks. One potentially useful and effective approach to these tasks is system behavior modeling. In this study this method is used to model schedule behavior of buses on a route using schedule-deviation information. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the application of artificial neural networks, which have been shown to hold promise then applied to nonlinear dynamic system-modeling problems, for developing schedule behavior models. Models are developed using the schedule-deviation information obtained from Tidewater Regional Transit's automatic vehicle-location system. The time-series analysis approach is adopted for the development of schedule behavior models at the route level. The results of a case study are encouraging and demonstrate the usefulness of artificial neural network techniques, especially the Jordan networks and the Elman networks, for modeling schedule deviations of buses on a route.},

abstract = {The maneuvering models of motorcycles in previous studies often considered motorcycles' traveling in terms of movements in a physical static lane and not in terms of dynamic virtual lane-based movements. For that reason, these models are not able to imitate motorcyclists' behavior well. This paper proposes a maneuverability model framework for motorcycles in queues at signalized intersections with considering the dynamic motorcycle's lane. The model includes (i) a dynamic motorcycle's lane to identify the current, left, and right lanes of the subject motorcycle, (ii) a threshold distance to determine when a motorcyclist starts to consider maneuvering, (iii) a lane selection model to identify the lane preferred by a motorcyclist, and (iv) a gap acceptance model to describe whether or not the lead and lag gaps are acceptable for maneuvering. The model framework captures the variation across the motorcyclist population and over time observations. The models were applied to Hanoi and Hochiminh city, Vietnam, based on microscopic data collected from video images. All of the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with the statistical estimation software GAUSS. The results show that 77.88{\%} of the observed maneuvers – either staying in the current lane or turning left or right – could be modeled correctly by the proposed models.},

@article{Dropout,
abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the ma- chine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting prob- lem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the- art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

abstract = {In recent years, several transit agencies have been trying to be more competitive with the automobile to attract choice riders. Transit agencies can only be competitive if they can provide services that are reliable, have a short access and egress time, and have run times that are comparable to automobiles. Several transit agencies try to be competitive through offering faster service, such as limited-stop (express) bus service. This study uses AVL and APC data, in addition to a disaggregate data obtained from a travel behavior survey, to select stops and estimate run times for a new limited-stop service that will run parallel to a heavily used bus route (67 Saint-Michel) in Montr??al, Canada. Three different scenarios are developed based on theory and practice to select stops to be incorporated in the new limited service. The time savings for each scenario are then evaluated as a range and a fourth scenario is developed. A limited-stop service is recommended based on selecting stops serving both directions of the route, major activity points and stop spacing. This study shows that implementing a limited-stop service would yield substantial time savings for both, the new limited service and the existing regular service running in parallel. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Since dwell time usually takes a large part of bus travel time, the large variability in dwell time always makes accurate prediction of arrival time$\backslash$travel time difficult. On the other hand, Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) and Automatic Passengers Counters (APC) systems are increasingly implemented for transit operation, which yield a vast amount of real time data. The emphasis of this research is to develop a bus dwell time model based on AVL and APC dynamic data, which is capable of providing real time information on bus arrival times. This model can be used for stop-based control strategies as well. The dwell time model established in this paper not only includes the number of passengers boarding and alighting, but also considers secondary factors like crowding and fare type. The number of boarding and alighting passengers is estimated by passenger arrival rate, bus headway, and capacity. Collection method, service mode, capacity restriction and occupancy of the vehicle are all taken into account in the model. Furthermore, the model is validated with the data of bus line Jiading 3 in Shanghai, China. It is compared with two previously developed models for the same route in four data sets. The results indicate that the models can be well applied in high demanded urban bus lines, especially in presence of high occupancy of vehicles. Since the effectiveness of estimation models is verified by statistical analysis methods, it will help in obtaining a reliable algorithm which can be adopted for bus arrival time/travel time prediction and assessing transit stop-based dynamic control actions.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal forecasting has various applications in neuroscience, climate and transportation domain. Traffic forecasting is one canonical example of such learning task. The task is challenging due to (1) complex spatial dependency on road networks, (2) non-linear temporal dynamics with changing road conditions and (3) inherent difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, we propose to model the traffic flow as a diffusion process on a directed graph and introduce Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting that incorporates both spatial and temporal dependency in the traffic flow. Specifically, DCRNN captures the spatial dependency using bidirectional random walks on the graph, and the temporal dependency using the encoder-decoder architecture with scheduled sampling. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large scale road network traffic datasets and observe consistent improvement of 12{\%} - 15{\%} over state-of-the-art baselines.},

Our method consists of three key components: 1) an active example selection algorithm to choose informative examples for training the classifier, 2) an ensemble learning method to combine variations of classifiers derived by active example selection, and 3) an incremental learning scheme to speed up the iterative training procedure for active example selection. We evaluate the method on six real-world imbalanced data sets in biomedical domains, showing that the proposed method outperforms both the random under sampling and the ensemble with under sampling methods.

Several methods, which include support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), k nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) and linear regression (LR), are adopted for the bus arrival time prediction. Observation surveys are conducted to collect bus running and arrival time data for validation of the proposed models. The results show that the proposed models are more accurate than the models based on the bus running times of single route. Moreover, it is found that the SVM model performs the best among the four proposed models for predicting the bus arrival times at bus stop with multiple routes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

To enhance urban mobility, much research was invested in traveling time prediction: given an origin and destination, provide a passenger with an accurate estimation of how long a journey lasts. In this work, we investigate a novel combination of methods from Queueing Theory and Machine Learning in the prediction process. We propose a prediction engine that, given a scheduled bus journey (route) and a 'source/destination' pair, provides an estimate for the traveling time, while considering both historical data and real-time streams of information that are transmitted by buses. We propose a model that uses natural segmentation of the data according to bus stops and a set of predictors, some use learning while others are learning-free, to compute traveling time. Our empirical evaluation, using bus data that comes from the bus network in the city of Dublin, demonstrates that the snapshot principle, taken from Queueing Theory, works well yet suffers from outliers. To overcome the outliers problem, we use Machine Learning techniques as a regulator that assists in identifying outliers and propose prediction based on historical data.},

abstract = {Dynamic at-stop real-time information displays are becoming more and more ubiquitous in modern public transport. Reactions and attitudes towards these systems are very positive. But there is a need to provide a comprehensive framework of the possible effects that these kinds of displays can have on customers. The seven main effects described in this paper are: (A) reduced wait time, (B) positive psychological factors, such as reduced uncertainty, increased ease-of-use and a greater feeling of security, (C) increased willingness-to-pay, (D) adjusted travel behaviour such as better use of wait time or more efficient travelling, (E) mode choice effects, (F) higher customer satisfaction and finally (G) better image. Two studies are presented in this paper. Study I supports and proves that perceived wait times can be reduced by 20{\%} by employing a before-after implementation evaluation study with questionnaires on a tramline. Study II shows the effects of real-time displays on behaviour in the form of adjusted walking speeds, by using a behaviour observation method in a subway station. The effect framework does not claim completeness and many effects are related to each other. However, the framework is a useful basis for designing evaluation studies and provides arguments in favour of at-stop real-time information displays. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems, which are a part of ITS, have been adopted by many transit agencies to track their vehicles and to predict travel time in real time.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Simulated climate dynamics, initialized with observed conditions, is expected to be synchronized, for several years, with the actual dynamics. However, the predictions of climate models are not sufficiently accurate. Moreover, there is a large variance between simulations initialized at different times and between different models. One way to improve climate predictions and to reduce the associated uncertainties is to use an ensemble of climate model predictions, weighted according to their past performances. Here, we show that skillful predictions, for a decadal time scale, of the 2 m temperature can be achieved by applying a sequential learning algorithm to an ensemble of decadal climate model simulations. The predictions generated by the learning algorithm are shown to be better than those of each of the models in the ensemble, the better performing simple average and a reference climatology. In addition, the uncertainties associated with the predictions are shown to be reduced relative to those derived from an equally weighted ensemble of bias-corrected predictions. The results show that learning algorithms can help to better assess future climate dynamics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example in genetics as we analyse larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time-series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalised likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favourably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods. We also compare with the Binary Segmentation algorithm for identifying changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.},

A dynamic travel time prediction model for buses addressing the cases on road with multiple bus routes is proposed in this paper, based on support vector machines (SVMs) and Kalman filtering-based algorithm. In the proposed model, the well-trained SVM model predicts the baseline bus travel times from the historical bus trip data; the Kalman filtering-based dynamic algorithm can adjust bus travel times with the latest bus operation information and the estimated baseline travel times. The performance of the proposed dynamic model is validated with the real-world data on road with multiple bus routes in Shenzhen, China. The results show that the proposed dynamic model is feasible and applicable for bus travel time prediction and has the best prediction performance among all the five models proposed in the study in terms of prediction accuracy on road with multiple bus routes.},

In this paper, we describe an efficient non-parametric algorithm which provides highly accurate predictions based on real-time GPS measurements. The key idea is to use a Kernel Regression model to represent the dependencies between position updates and the arrival times at bus stops. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on real data from the public bus transportation system in Dublin, Ireland. For a time horizon of 50 minutes, the prediction error of the algorithm is less than 10 percent on average. It clearly outperforms parametric methods which use a Linear Regression model, predictions based on the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, and a system which computes predictions of arrival times based on the current delay of buses. A study investigating the selection of interpolation points to reduce the size of the training set concludes the paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The HMM elegantly accounts for measurement noise and the layout of the road network. We test our algorithm on ground truth data collected from a GPS receiver in a vehicle. Our test shows how the algorithm breaks down as the sampling rate of the GPS is reduced. We also test the effect of increasing amounts of additional measurement noise in order to assess how well our algorithm could deal with the inaccuracies of other location measurement systems, such as those based on WiFi and cell tower multilateration. We provide our GPS data and road network representation as a standard test set for other researchers to use in their map matching work.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

In order to enhance the performance of the MRT-bus transfer system, we develop several fuzzy rules in the transfer models that are different functions of the travel time taken by buses during different time periods, such as rush hours and off-peak hours. Real-time traffic information acquired by the intelligent transportation systems through global positioning systems is used as input data for the FBHS. A performance index function is derived and served as the performance measure to compare our system with real data.

For that reason, these models are not able to imitate motorcyclists' behavior well. This paper proposes a maneuverability model framework for motorcycles in queues at signalized intersections with considering the dynamic motorcycle's lane. The model includes (i) a dynamic motorcycle's lane to identify the current, left, and right lanes of the subject motorcycle, (ii) a threshold distance to determine when a motorcyclist starts to consider maneuvering, (iii) a lane selection model to identify the lane preferred by a motorcyclist, and (iv) a gap acceptance model to describe whether or not the lead and lag gaps are acceptable for maneuvering. The model framework captures the variation across the motorcyclist population and over time observations. The models were applied to Hanoi and Hochiminh city, Vietnam, based on microscopic data collected from video images. All of the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with the statistical estimation software GAUSS. The results show that 77.88{\%} of the observed maneuvers – either staying in the current lane or turning left or right – could be modeled correctly by the proposed models.},

abstract = {Providing real-time and accurate travel time information of transit vehicles can be very helpful as it assists passengers in planning their trips to minimize waiting times. The purpose of this research is to develop and compare dynamic travel time prediction models which can provide accurate prediction of bus travel time in order to give real-time information at a given downstream bus stop using only global positioning system (GPS) data. Historical Average (HA), Kalman Filtering (KF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are considered and developed in this paper. A case has been studied by making use of the three models. Promising results are obtained from the case study, indicating that the models can be used to implement an Advanced Public Transport System. The implementation of this system could assist transit operators in improving the reliability of bus services, thus attracting more travelers to transit vehicles and helping relieve congestion. The performances of the three models were assessed and compared with each other under two criteria: overall prediction accuracy and robustness. It was shown that the ANN outperformed the other two models in both aspects. In conclusion, it is shown that bus travel time information can be reasonably provided using only arrival and departure time information at stops even in the absence of traffic-stream data.},

This foundation rests on the Wold decomposition theorem and on the assertion that a one-week lagged first seasonal difference applied to discrete interval traffic condition data will yield a weakly stationary transformation.

abstract = {Bus headway in a rural area usually is much larger than that in an urban area. Providing real-time bus arrival information could make the public transit system more user-friendly and thus enhance its competitiveness among various transportation modes. As part of an operational test for rural traveler information systems currently ongoing in Blacksburg, Virginia, an experimental study has been conducted on forecasting the arrival time of the next bus with automatic vehicle location techniques. The process of developing arrival time estimation algorithms is discussed, including route representation, global positioning system (GPS) data screening for identifying data quality and delay patterns, algorithm formulation, and development of measures of performance. Whereas GPS-based bus location data are adopted in all four algorithms presented, the extent to which other information is used in these algorithms varies. In addition to bus location data, information relevant to the performance of an algorithm includes scheduled arrival time, delay correlation, and waiting time at time-check stops. The performance of an algorithm using different levels of information is compared against three criteria: overall precision, robustness, and stability. Results show that at the site where the study is being conducted, the dwell time at time-check stops is most relevant to the performance of an algorithm.},

abstract = {A vast majority of urban transportation systems in North America are equipped with traffic surveillance systems that provide real time traffic information to traffic management centers. The information from these are processed and provided back to the travelers in real time. However, the travelers are interested to know not only the current traffic information, but also the future traffic conditions predicted based on the real time data. These predicted values inform the drivers on what they can expect when they make the trip. Travel time is one of the most popular variables which the users are interested to know. Travelers make decisions to bypass congested segments of the network, to change departure time or destination etc., based on this information. Hence it is important that the predicted values be as accurate as possible. A number of different forecasting methods have been proposed for travel time forecasting including historic method, real-time method, time series analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANN). This paper examines the use of a machine learning technique, namely support vector machines (SVM), for the short-term prediction of travel time. While other machine learning techniques, such as ANN, have been extensively studied, the reported applications of SVM in the field of transportation engineering are very few. A comparison of the performance of SVM with ANN, real time, and historic approach is carried out. Data from the TransGuide Traffic Management center in San Antonio, Texas, USA is used for the analysis. From the results it was found that SVM is a viable alternative for short-term prediction problems when the amount of data is less or noisy in nature. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {The accuracy of travel time information given to passengers plays a key role in the success of any Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) application. In order to improve the accuracy of such applications, one should carefully develop a prediction method. A majority of the available prediction methods considered the variation in travel time either spatially or temporally. The present study developed a prediction method that considers both temporal and spatial variations in travel time. The conservation of vehicles equation in terms of flow and density was first re-written in terms of speed in the form of a partial differential equation using traffic stream models. Then, the developed speed based equation was discretized using the Godunov scheme and used in the prediction scheme that was based on the Kalman filter. From the results, it was found that the proposed method was able to perform better than historical average, regression, and ANN methods and the methods that considered either temporal or spatial variations alone. Finally, a formulation was developed to check the effect of side roads on prediction accuracy and it was found that the additional requirement in terms of location based data did not result in an appreciable change in the prediction accuracy. This clearly demonstrated that the proposed approach based on using vehicle tracking data is good enough for the considered application of bus travel time prediction.},

We describe a system for online map matching in the backend that implements a state of the art algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model. This system uses only open source software and open data. The development of the map matcher was motivated by a perceived lack of a scalable system in the open source realm. We discuss its role as part of a scalable backend system designed to provide spatially aware services.},

abstract = {Neural networks have been widely used as a promising method for time series forecasting. However, limited empirical studies on seasonal time series forecasting with neural networks yield mixed results. While some find that neural networks are able to model seasonality directly and prior deseasonalization is not necessary, others conclude just the opposite. In this paper, we investigate the issue of how to effectively model time series with both seasonal and trend patterns. In particular, we study the effectiveness of data preprocessing, including deseasonalization and detrending, on neural network modeling and forecasting performance. Both simulation and real data are examined and results are compared to those obtained from the Box-Jenkins seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models. We find that neural networks are not able to capture seasonal or trend variations effectively with the unpreprocessed raw data and either detrending or deseasonalization can dramatically reduce forecasting errors. Moreover, a combined detrending and deseasonalization is found to be the most effective data preprocessing approach. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Efficiently and effectively run public transit systems are essential components of and crucial contributors to the proper functioning of a region's overall transportation network. However, travel by public transit is a complex process that involves more than simply people moving about on buses and trains. A typical door-to-door trip involves walking from one's origin to a bus stop or train station, waiting for a vehicle to arrive, boarding the vehicle, traveling in the vehicle, alighting from the vehicle, and then walking to one's final destination. In many cases, the trip also involves transfers; travelers alight from one transit vehicle, move to a new stop or platform, wait for another transit vehicle, board that vehicle and continue this process until they reach their last stop or station at which time they then must walk to their final destination. Therefore, transit travelers expend a great deal of their time, energy, and patience outside of buses and trains, and this contributes greatly to both their actual and perceived burden of transit travel. This added burden influences the travelers' decisions on whether or not to take transit in the future. Given the relative convenience of door-to-door travel by foot, bicycle, taxi, or private vehicle for many trips, public transit systems are often at a competitive disadvantage when competing for passengers. This research examines ways to increase the attractiveness of public transportation and reduce the perceived burden of the time spent outside of vehicles during transit trips.},

abstract = {With the ubiquity of the Internet, platforms such as: Google, Wikipedia and the like can provide insights pertaining to firms' financial performance as well as capture the collective interest of traders through search trends, number of web page visitors and/or financial news sentiment. Information emanating from these platforms can significantly affect, or be affected by, changes in the stock market. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop a financial expert system that incorporates these features to predict short term stock prices. Our expert system is comprised of two main modules: a knowledge base and an artificial intelligence (AI) platform. The “knowledge base” for our expert system captures: (a) historical stock prices; (b) several well-known technical indicators; (c) counts and sentiment scores of published news articles for a given stock; (d) trends in Google searches for the given stock ticker; and (e) number of unique visitors for pertinent Wikipedia pages. Once the data is collected, we use a structured approach for data preparation. Then, the AI platform trains four machine learning ensemble methods: (a) a neural network regression ensemble; (b) a support vector regression ensemble; (c) a boosted regression tree; and (d) a random forest regression. In the cross-validation phase, the AI platform picks the “best” ensemble for a given stock. To evaluate the efficacy of our expert system, we first present a case study based on the Citi Group stock ({\$}C) with data collected from 01/01/2013 - 12/31/2016. We show the expert system can predict the 1-day ahead {\$}C stock price with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ≤ 1.50{\%} and the 1–10 day ahead with a MAPE ≤ 1.89{\%}, which is better than the reported results in the literature. We show that the use of features extracted from online sources does not substitute the traditional financial metrics, but rather supplements them to improve upon the prediction performance of machine learning based methods. To highlight the utility and generalizability of our expert system, we predict the 1-day ahead price of 19 additional stocks from different industries, volatilities and growth patterns. We report an overall mean for the MAPE statistic of 1.07{\%} across our five different machine learning models, including a MAPE of under 0.75{\%} for 18 of the 19 stocks for the best ensemble (boosted regression tree).},

The prediction generated by the proposed hybrid scheme integrates three travel time components: schedule, instantaneous and historical data. Genetic algorithm is applied in order to specify the contribution of each data source component to the prediction scheme. The benefits, transferability and estimation form of the proposed scheme were tested by applying it on three trunk bus lines in Stockholm, Sweden.

An on- going study makes use of Automatic Vehicle Location data (AVL) of bus Line 31 in Zurich to estimate quantitative operational reliability measures. A number of in-vehicle observations during peak periods, and aggregate operational data reports complement the detailed AVL data. The main objective is to shed light on the major causes of reliability problems in Line 31 by first identifying where the problems are located and how performance varies throughout the day. Initial results indicate that intersections contribute most to delays, even with the presence of active priority for vehicles at traffic lights. In Zurich, high reliability levels are achieved with a limited level of segregation and exclusive lanes. Together with priority measures, holding strategies and timetables with sufficient recovery times are considered to contribute most to a stable operation. It is not expected that reliability can be significantly improved without a higher degree of segregation from the rest of the traffic. The results of this work provide a quantitative benchmark to which further improvements in the service can be compared. It can also prove useful to cities looking for ways to improve the reliability of their urban bus services. Further work will deal with the analysis of timetable design, buffer time allocation and holding strategies.},

abstract = {Short-term passenger demand forecasting is of great importance to the on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependences, temporal dependences, and exogenous dependences need to be considered simultaneously, however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependences within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection. The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China. Experimental results, validated on real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing, show that the FCL-Net achieves better predictive performance than traditional approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and neural network based algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network and LSTM). This paper is one of the first DL studies to forecast the short-term passenger demand of an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal correlations.},

@article{Cervero1990,
abstract = {Several decades of research on transit pricing have provided clear insights into how riders respond to price changes in both the transit and automobile sectors. For the most part, riders are insensitive to changes in either fare levels, structures, or forms of payments, though this varies considerably among user groups and operating environments. Since riders are approximately twice as sensitive to changes in travel time as they are to changes in fares, a compelling argument can be made for operating more premium quality transit services at higher prices. Such programs could be supplemented by vouchers and concessionary programs to reduce the burden of higher fares on love-income users. Also, cross-elasticity research suggests that higher automobile prices would have a significantly greater affect on ridership than lower fares. Most research on transit fare structures shows that the common practice of fiat fares is highly inequitable, penalizing short-distance and off-peak users. Free fare programs have proven quite costly for each new' transit user attracted and have rarely lured motorists to transit. Free fares limited to downtowns have been more successful than systemwide free fare programs. While prepayment schemes have met with success in the U.S. and Europe, honor fares h{\~{}},ve suffered from excessive revenue losses in at least one case in the U.S, Some of the more noteworthy fare policy successes in North America have been Bridgeport's combined pass-fare program, Allentown's deep discounts, Ottawa's major fare reduction and differentiation, and Columbus's substantial midday discount. As paratransit and other new transit alternatives to conventional bus continue to emerge, new, more differentiated fare practices can be expected in the future.},
