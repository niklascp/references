abstract = {The maneuvering models of motorcycles in previous studies often considered motorcycles' traveling in terms of movements in a physical static lane and not in terms of dynamic virtual lane-based movements. For that reason, these models are not able to imitate motorcyclists' behavior well. This paper proposes a maneuverability model framework for motorcycles in queues at signalized intersections with considering the dynamic motorcycle's lane. The model includes (i) a dynamic motorcycle's lane to identify the current, left, and right lanes of the subject motorcycle, (ii) a threshold distance to determine when a motorcyclist starts to consider maneuvering, (iii) a lane selection model to identify the lane preferred by a motorcyclist, and (iv) a gap acceptance model to describe whether or not the lead and lag gaps are acceptable for maneuvering. The model framework captures the variation across the motorcyclist population and over time observations. The models were applied to Hanoi and Hochiminh city, Vietnam, based on microscopic data collected from video images. All of the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with the statistical estimation software GAUSS. The results show that 77.88{\%} of the observed maneuvers – either staying in the current lane or turning left or right – could be modeled correctly by the proposed models.},

abstract = {Accurate and real-time travel time information for buses can help passengers better plan their trips and minimize waiting times. A dynamic travel time prediction model for buses addressing the cases on road with multiple bus routes is proposed in this paper, based on support vector machines (SVMs) and Kalman filtering-based algorithm. In the proposed model, the well-trained SVM model predicts the baseline bus travel times from the historical bus trip data; the Kalman filtering-based dynamic algorithm can adjust bus travel times with the latest bus operation information and the estimated baseline travel times. The performance of the proposed dynamic model is validated with the real-world data on road with multiple bus routes in Shenzhen, China. The results show that the proposed dynamic model is feasible and applicable for bus travel time prediction and has the best prediction performance among all the five models proposed in the study in terms of prediction accuracy on road with multiple bus routes.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

These systems send a stream of position annotated messages when requesting location based services. The position information in turn can be used to improve those services. Here, we focus on online map matching of the most recent position of a connected vehicle on a road map. This information, aggregated and privacy aware, can serve as a basis e.g. for machine learning algorithms used to improve traffic prediction. We describe a system for online map matching in the backend that implements a state of the art algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model. This system uses only open source software and open data. The development of the map matcher was motivated by a perceived lack of a scalable system in the open source realm. We discuss its role as part of a scalable backend system designed to provide spatially aware services.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t On high-frequency routes, transit agencies hold buses at control points and seek to dispatch them with even headways to avoid bus bunching. This paper compares holding methods used in practice and recommended in the literature using simulated and historical data from Tri-Met route 72 in Portland, Oregon. We evaluated the performance of each holding method in terms of headway instability and mean holding time. We tested the sensitivity of holding methods to their parameterization and to the number of control points. We found that Schedule-Based methods require little holding time but are unable to stabilize headways even when applied at a high control point density. The Headway-Based methods are able to successfully control headways but they require long holding times. Prediction-Based methods achieve the best compromise between headway regularity and holding time on a wide range of desired trade-offs. Finally, we found the prediction-based methods to be sen-sitive to prediction accuracy, but using an existing prediction method we were able to min-imize this sensitivity. These results can be used to inform the decision of transit agencies to implement holding methods on routes similar to TriMet 72. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The purpose of this research is to develop and compare dynamic travel time prediction models which can provide accurate prediction of bus travel time in order to give real-time information at a given downstream bus stop using only global positioning system (GPS) data. Historical Average (HA), Kalman Filtering (KF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are considered and developed in this paper. A case has been studied by making use of the three models. Promising results are obtained from the case study, indicating that the models can be used to implement an Advanced Public Transport System. The implementation of this system could assist transit operators in improving the reliability of bus services, thus attracting more travelers to transit vehicles and helping relieve congestion. The performances of the three models were assessed and compared with each other under two criteria: overall prediction accuracy and robustness. It was shown that the ANN outperformed the other two models in both aspects. In conclusion, it is shown that bus travel time information can be reasonably provided using only arrival and departure time information at stops even in the absence of traffic-stream data.},

However, the predictions of climate models are not sufficiently accurate. Moreover, there is a large variance between simulations initialized at different times and between different models. One way to improve climate predictions and to reduce the associated uncertainties is to use an ensemble of climate model predictions, weighted according to their past performances. Here, we show that skillful predictions, for a decadal time scale, of the 2 m temperature can be achieved by applying a sequential learning algorithm to an ensemble of decadal climate model simulations. The predictions generated by the learning algorithm are shown to be better than those of each of the models in the ensemble, the better performing simple average and a reference climatology. In addition, the uncertainties associated with the predictions are shown to be reduced relative to those derived from an equally weighted ensemble of bias-corrected predictions. The results show that learning algorithms can help to better assess future climate dynamics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Dropout,
abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

abstract = {In this paper, the concept of using bus probes for urban street travel time estimation in the advanced traveler information system (ATIS) application is investigated through both a thorough literature review and a case study in downtown Chicago using the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)'s buses. First, existing bus probes studies are reviewed and compared with respect to the research objectives, facility type, data source, modeling technique, and key research findings. The literature supports the concept of bus probes to ATIS applications. However, the past studies have focused on highways (freeways and principal arterials) and used what is called archived automatic vehicle location (AVL) bus data, which are not suitable for real time forecasting (online updating). The case study presented in the second part of the paper is the first of its kind that uses real-time bus tracking data for urban signalized street travel time estimation. Multivariate time series state-space modeling techniques are applied. The case study finds significant interrelation between bus and car speeds. In particular, stronger influence of car operations (in terms of speed) is found on bus operations in the traffic stream than buses on cars. These findings indicate that AVL buses are plausible probes for urban street ATIS. This conclusion, however, must be understood within the study limitations discussed at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {Efficiently and effectively run public transit systems are essential components of and crucial contributors to the proper functioning of a region's overall transportation network. However, travel by public transit is a complex process that involves more than simply people moving about on buses and trains. A typical door-to-door trip involves walking from one's origin to a bus stop or train station, waiting for a vehicle to arrive, boarding the vehicle, traveling in the vehicle, alighting from the vehicle, and then walking to one's final destination. In many cases, the trip also involves transfers; travelers alight from one transit vehicle, move to a new stop or platform, wait for another transit vehicle, board that vehicle and continue this process until they reach their last stop or station at which time they then must walk to their final destination. Therefore, transit travelers expend a great deal of their time, energy, and patience outside of buses and trains, and this contributes greatly to both their actual and perceived burden of transit travel. This added burden influences the travelers' decisions on whether or not to take transit in the future. Given the relative convenience of door-to-door travel by foot, bicycle, taxi, or private vehicle for many trips, public transit systems are often at a competitive disadvantage when competing for passengers. This research examines ways to increase the attractiveness of public transportation and reduce the perceived burden of the time spent outside of vehicles during transit trips.},

abstract = {Reliability of public transport systems has been considered critically important by public$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntransport users, operators and the government. Lack of reliability in public transport results in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nuncertainty and delays aggravating anxiety and discomfort for the passengers and increases$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncosts due to lost mileage and lower fleet utilisation for the operators. The government$\backslash$r$\backslash$nemphasises a reliable bus-service in order to ensure its competitiveness to car use such that$\backslash$r$\backslash$nit results in modal shift. Though reliability is of significance to a range of actors such as the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbus operators and the passengers, its interpretations vary across different groups. For$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexample, quality of service identified by the demand-oriented indicators, the travellers, is$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsystematically different from what the supply-based quality indicators show. Reliability, as a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmeasure of quality of service, is related to the operational characteristics of the public$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntransport system. Passenger's wait time, on the other hand, is much more sensitive to$\backslash$r$\backslash$nschedule reliability than to service frequency.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis paper investigates some of the measures used to assess reliability of an urban bus$\backslash$r$\backslash$nnetwork using a dynamic microsimulation model framework. The framework incorporates$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmodels of bus operation, passenger arrival and boarding for buses within a network model of$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngeneral traffic. It therefore allows explicit modelling of the interactions among cars, buses$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand passengers and of their effect on bus reliability. The model framework is applied to a$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncase study based on a bus route in the city of York. Empirical analysis of the test route was$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncarried out to understand the background of reliability issues and to establish a sound base$\backslash$r$\backslash$nscenario of the network. The simulation model is used to help understand the causes and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprocess of occurrence of unreliability and to study the impacts of possible scenarios such as$\backslash$r$\backslash$nincreased congestion, rise in passenger demand, and reduction in ‘per passenger boarding$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntime' on the reliability of the test-route. The study measures reliability in terms of travel time,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nheadways and excess passenger wait time, and sheds light on factors affecting them.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe results of the study reveal that excess passenger wait time is strongly correlated with the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nvariation of headways and an increase in passenger demand intensifies the ‘bunching and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nspreading out' of buses. With increasing congestion and passenger demand, reliability is$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreduced. Reduction in per passenger boarding time proves to be an effective measure in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimproving reliability.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nBeyond these specific case study results, the modelling framework developed may serve as$\backslash$r$\backslash$na useful tool to assess reliability levels for a future year and to evaluate proposed strategies$\backslash$r$\backslash$nto improve reliability before implementation. Such a modelling framework, if extended to$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncover larger bus networks can serve as an important decision-making tool in the hands of the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngovernment and bus operators for offering more reliable bus services to the public.},

Providing real-time bus arrival information could make the public transit system more user-friendly and thus enhance its competitiveness among various transportation modes. As part of an operational test for rural traveler information systems currently ongoing in Blacksburg, Virginia, an experimental study has been conducted on forecasting the arrival time of the next bus with automatic vehicle location techniques. The process of developing arrival time estimation algorithms is discussed, including route representation, global positioning system (GPS) data screening for identifying data quality and delay patterns, algorithm formulation, and development of measures of performance. Whereas GPS-based bus location data are adopted in all four algorithms presented, the extent to which other information is used in these algorithms varies. In addition to bus location data, information relevant to the performance of an algorithm includes scheduled arrival time, delay correlation, and waiting time at time-check stops. The performance of an algorithm using different levels of information is compared against three criteria: overall precision, robustness, and stability. Results show that at the site where the study is being conducted, the dwell time at time-check stops is most relevant to the performance of an algorithm.},

abstract = {In recent years, several transit agencies have been trying to be more competitive with the automobile to attract choice riders. Transit agencies can only be competitive if they can provide services that are reliable, have a short access and egress time, and have run times that are comparable to automobiles. Several transit agencies try to be competitive through offering faster service, such as limited-stop (express) bus service. This study uses AVL and APC data, in addition to a disaggregate data obtained from a travel behavior survey, to select stops and estimate run times for a new limited-stop service that will run parallel to a heavily used bus route (67 Saint-Michel) in Montr??al, Canada. Three different scenarios are developed based on theory and practice to select stops to be incorporated in the new limited service. The time savings for each scenario are then evaluated as a range and a fourth scenario is developed. A limited-stop service is recommended based on selecting stops serving both directions of the route, major activity points and stop spacing. This study shows that implementing a limited-stop service would yield substantial time savings for both, the new limited service and the existing regular service running in parallel. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The maneuvering models of motorcycles in previous studies often considered motorcycles' traveling in terms of movements in a physical static lane and not in terms of dynamic virtual lane-based movements. For that reason, these models are not able to imitate motorcyclists' behavior well. This paper proposes a maneuverability model framework for motorcycles in queues at signalized intersections with considering the dynamic motorcycle's lane. The model includes (i) a dynamic motorcycle's lane to identify the current, left, and right lanes of the subject motorcycle, (ii) a threshold distance to determine when a motorcyclist starts to consider maneuvering, (iii) a lane selection model to identify the lane preferred by a motorcyclist, and (iv) a gap acceptance model to describe whether or not the lead and lag gaps are acceptable for maneuvering. The model framework captures the variation across the motorcyclist population and over time observations. The models were applied to Hanoi and Hochiminh city, Vietnam, based on microscopic data collected from video images. All of the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with the statistical estimation software GAUSS. The results show that 77.88{\%} of the observed maneuvers – either staying in the current lane or turning left or right – could be modeled correctly by the proposed models.},

At Uber, probabilistic time series forecasting is used for robust prediction of number of trips during special events, driver incentive allocation, as well as real-time anomaly detection across millions of metrics. Classical time series models are often used in conjunction with a probabilistic formulation for uncertainty estimation. However, such models are hard to tune, scale, and add exogenous variables to. Motivated by the recent resurgence of Long Short Term Memory networks, we propose a novel end-to-end Bayesian deep model that provides time series prediction along with uncertainty estimation.

In the contest of prediction methodologies, different time series, and artificial neural networks (ANN) models have been developed in addition to the historic and real time approach. The present paper proposes the application of a recently developed pattern classification and regression technique called support vector machines (SVM) for the short-term prediction of traffic speed. An ANN model is also developed and a comparison of the performance of both these techniques is carried out, along with real time and historic approach results. Data from the freeways of San Antonio, Texas were used for the analysis.},

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) are one component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and a major component of ATIS is travel time information. Automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems, which are a part of ITS, have been adopted by many transit agencies to track their vehicles and to predict travel time in real time. Because of the complexity involved, there is no universally adopted approach for this latter application, and research is needed in this area. The objectives of the research in this paper are to develop a model to predict bus arrival time using AVL data and apply the model for real-time applications.

Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the ma- chine learning perspective.

By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting prob- lem.

@article{Sun2007,
abstract = {A number of studies have been initiated in the past to address the bus arrival time prediction problem. These efforts have resulted in three types of prediction models: (a) models based on historical data, (b) multilinear regression models, and (c) artificial neural network models. The first type of prediction models infers the current and future travel time of a bus based on the historical travel time of the same bus or other buses. Lin and Zeng (4) proposed a set of bus arrival time prediction algorithms for a transit traveler information system implemented in Blacksburg, Virginia. Four algorithms were intro-duced with different assumptions on input data and were shown to outperform several algorithms from the literature. Their algorithms, however, did not consider the effect of traffic congestion and dwell time at bus stations. Kidwell (5) presented an algorithm for predicting bus arrival times based on real-time vehicle location. The algorithm worked by dividing each route into zones and recording the time that each bus passed through each zone. Predictions were based on the most recent observation of a bus passing through each zone. However, this algorithm was not suitable for large cities where both travel time and dwell time could be subject to large variations. Generally speak-ing, these models are reliable only when the traffic pattern in the area of interest is relatively stable. One of their main limitations is that it requires an extensive set of historical data, which may not be available in practice, especially when the traffic pattern varies significantly over time. The second approach is applying mathematical models to predict the expected travel times between stops and then the expected bus arrival times at individual stops. These models are usually established by regressing travel times against a set of independent variables, such as traffic conditions, ridership, number of intermediate stops, and weather condition. Patnaik et al. (6) developed a set of regression models to estimate bus arrival times with data collected by automatic passenger counters installed on buses. The results obtained were promising and indicated that the developed models could be used to estimate bus arrival times under various conditions. However, this approach is reliable only when such equations can be established, which may not be possible for many application environments where many of the system variables are typically correlated. The third approach is applying artificial neural networks (ANN) that are capable of capturing complex nonlinear relationships. Jeong and Rilett (7) proposed an ANN model for predicting bus arrival times and demonstrated its superior performance as compared with other methods. However, ANN models require extensive training The ability to obtain accurate predictions of bus arrival time on a real-time basis is a vital element to both bus operations control and passenger information systems. Several studies had been devoted to this arrival time prediction problem; however, few resulted in completely satisfactory algorithms. This paper presents a new system that can be used to predict the expected bus arrival times at individual bus stops along a service route. The proposed prediction algorithm combines real-time location data from Global Positioning System receivers with average travel speeds of individual route segments, taking into account historical travel speed as well as temporal and spatial variations of traffic conditions. A geographic information system–based map-matching algorithm is used to project each received location onto the underlying transit network. The system is implemented as a finite state machine to ensure its regularity, stability, and robustness under a wide range of operating conditions. A case study on a real bus route is conducted to evaluate the performance of the pro-posed system in terms of prediction accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed system is capable of achieving satisfactory accuracy in pre-dicting bus arrival times and perfect performance in predicting travel direction. Accurate prediction of the expected arrival time of the next bus at individual bus stops is of significant value to both transit operators and users. With this arrival time information, transit operators can promptly respond to unexpected service interruptions and delays by introducing various bus control strategies, such as holding and stop-skipping (1). In the long term, transit operators could spot problematic routes and shifts that chronically run late and promptly take man-agerial and technical actions—such as training operators, adjusting schedules, and implementing transit signal priority—for improved performance. The overall quality of transit service could therefore be improved, which would ultimately make the public transporta-tion mode more user-friendly and attractive as compared with other transportation modes such as driving. Bus arrival time information can also be disseminated to travelers through various mediums such as electronic boards installed at bus stops, Internet, cable TV, and cellular phones (2, 3). Such information could reduce passengers' anxieties while waiting for buses and save them travel time because they can time their arrival at the bus stops more close to the schedule. Better information therefore helps retain},

In this study this method is used to model schedule behavior of buses on a route using schedule-deviation information. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the application of artificial neural networks, which have been shown to hold promise then applied to nonlinear dynamic system-modeling problems, for developing schedule behavior models. Models are developed using the schedule-deviation information obtained from Tidewater Regional Transit's automatic vehicle-location system. The time-series analysis approach is adopted for the development of schedule behavior models at the route level.

abstract = {A vast majority of urban transportation systems in North America are equipped with traffic surveillance systems that provide real time traffic information to traffic management centers. The information from these are processed and provided back to the travelers in real time. However, the travelers are interested to know not only the current traffic information, but also the future traffic conditions predicted based on the real time data. These predicted values inform the drivers on what they can expect when they make the trip. Travel time is one of the most popular variables which the users are interested to know. Travelers make decisions to bypass congested segments of the network, to change departure time or destination etc., based on this information. Hence it is important that the predicted values be as accurate as possible. A number of different forecasting methods have been proposed for travel time forecasting including historic method, real-time method, time series analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANN). This paper examines the use of a machine learning technique, namely support vector machines (SVM), for the short-term prediction of travel time. While other machine learning techniques, such as ANN, have been extensively studied, the reported applications of SVM in the field of transportation engineering are very few. A comparison of the performance of SVM with ANN, real time, and historic approach is carried out. Data from the TransGuide Traffic Management center in San Antonio, Texas, USA is used for the analysis. From the results it was found that SVM is a viable alternative for short-term prediction problems when the amount of data is less or noisy in nature. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

In this paper, we describe an efficient non-parametric algorithm which provides highly accurate predictions based on real-time GPS measurements. The key idea is to use a Kernel Regression model to represent the dependencies between position updates and the arrival times at bus stops. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on real data from the public bus transportation system in Dublin, Ireland. For a time horizon of 50 minutes, the prediction error of the algorithm is less than 10 percent on average. It clearly outperforms parametric methods which use a Linear Regression model, predictions based on the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, and a system which computes predictions of arrival times based on the current delay of buses. A study investigating the selection of interpolation points to reduce the size of the training set concludes the paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Traffic flow in major urban roads is affected by several factors. It is often interrupted by stochastic conditions, such as traffic lights, road conditions, number of vehicles on the road, time of travel, weather conditions, driving style of vehicles. The provision of timely and accurate travel time information of transit vehicles is valuable for both operators and passengers, especially when dispatching is based on estimation of potential passengers waiting along the route rather than the predefined time schedule. Operators manage their dispatches in real time, and passengers can form travel preferences dynamically. Arrival time estimation for time scheduled public transport busses have been studied by many researchers using various paradigms. However, dynamic prediction on some type of transit vehicles, which do not follow any dispatch time schedule, or stop station constrains introduces extra complexities. In this paper, a survey on the recent studies using historical data, statistical methods, Kalman Filters and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been applied to GPS data collected from transit vehicles, are collected with an emphasis on their model and architecture.},

abstract = {Provision of accurate bus arrival information is vital to passengers for reducing their anxieties and waiting times at bus stop. This paper proposes models to predict bus arrival times at the same bus stop but with different routes. In the proposed models, bus running times of multiple routes are used for predicting the bus arrival time of each of these bus routes. Several methods, which include support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), k nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) and linear regression (LR), are adopted for the bus arrival time prediction. Observation surveys are conducted to collect bus running and arrival time data for validation of the proposed models. The results show that the proposed models are more accurate than the models based on the bus running times of single route. Moreover, it is found that the SVM model performs the best among the four proposed models for predicting the bus arrival times at bus stop with multiple routes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Short-term passenger demand forecasting is of great importance to the on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependences, temporal dependences, and exogenous dependences need to be considered simultaneously, however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependences within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection. The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China. Experimental results, validated on real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing, show that the FCL-Net achieves better predictive performance than traditional approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and neural network based algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network and LSTM). This paper is one of the first DL studies to forecast the short-term passenger demand of an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal correlations.},

abstract = {The success of multi-model ensemble combination has been demonstrated in many studies. Given that a multi-model contains information from all participating models, including the less skilful ones, the question remains as to why, and under what conditions, a multi-model can outperform the best participating single model. It is the aim of this paper to resolve this apparent paradox. The study is based on a synthetic forecast generator, allowing the generation of perfectly-calibrated single-model ensembles of any size and skill. Additionally, the degree of ensemble under-dispersion (or overconfidence) can be prescribed. Multi-model ensembles are then constructed from both weighted and unweighted averages of these single-model ensembles. Applying this toy model, we carry out systematic model-combination experiments. We evaluate how multi-model performance depends on the skill and overconfidence of the participating single models. It turns out that multi-model ensembles can indeed locally outperform a ‘best-model' approach, but only if the single-model ensembles are overconfident. The reason is that multi-model combination reduces overconfidence, i.e. ensemble spread is widened while average ensemble-mean error is reduced. This implies a net gain in prediction skill, because probabilistic skill scores penalize overconfidence. Under these conditions, even the addition of an objectively-poor model can improve multi-model skill. It seems that simple ensemble inflation methods cannot yield the same skill improvement. Using seasonal near-surface temperature forecasts from the DEMETER dataset, we show that the conclusions drawn from the toy-model experiments hold equally in a real multi-model ensemble prediction system.

The HMM elegantly accounts for measurement noise and the layout of the road network. We test our algorithm on ground truth data collected from a GPS receiver in a vehicle. Our test shows how the algorithm breaks down as the sampling rate of the GPS is reduced. We also test the effect of increasing amounts of additional measurement noise in order to assess how well our algorithm could deal with the inaccuracies of other location measurement systems, such as those based on WiFi and cell tower multilateration.

To enhance urban mobility, much research was invested in traveling time prediction: given an origin and destination, provide a passenger with an accurate estimation of how long a journey lasts. In this work, we investigate a novel combination of methods from Queueing Theory and Machine Learning in the prediction process. We propose a prediction engine that, given a scheduled bus journey (route) and a 'source/destination' pair, provides an estimate for the traveling time, while considering both historical data and real-time streams of information that are transmitted by buses. We propose a model that uses natural segmentation of the data according to bus stops and a set of predictors, some use learning while others are learning-free, to compute traveling time. Our empirical evaluation, using bus data that comes from the bus network in the city of Dublin, demonstrates that the snapshot principle, taken from Queueing Theory, works well yet suffers from outliers. To overcome the outliers problem, we use Machine Learning techniques as a regulator that assists in identifying outliers and propose prediction based on historical data.},

In this paper we propose a method to predict freeway travel times using a linear model in which the coefficients vary as smooth functions of the departure time. The method is straightforward to implement, computationally efficient and applicable to widely available freeway sensor data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying the method to two real-life loop detector data sets. The first data set-on I-880-is relatively small in scale, but very high in quality, containing information from probe vehicles and double loop detectors. On this data set the prediction error ranges from 5{\%} for a trip leaving immediately to 10{\%} for a trip leaving 30 min or more in the future. Having obtained encouraging results from the small data set, we move on to apply the method to a data set on a much larger spatial scale, from Caltrans District 12 in Los Angeles. On this data set, our errors range from about 8{\%} at zero lag to 13{\%} at a time lag of 30 min or more. We also investigate several extensions to the original method in the context of this larger data set. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Public transport operators aim to provide higher levels of reliability for their users because reliable services are more attractive, and can also reduce operating costs for the agency. This work addresses the issue in a context where high-quality public transport is the norm. An on- going study makes use of Automatic Vehicle Location data (AVL) of bus Line 31 in Zurich to estimate quantitative operational reliability measures. A number of in-vehicle observations during peak periods, and aggregate operational data reports complement the detailed AVL data. The main objective is to shed light on the major causes of reliability problems in Line 31 by first identifying where the problems are located and how performance varies throughout the day. Initial results indicate that intersections contribute most to delays, even with the presence of active priority for vehicles at traffic lights. In Zurich, high reliability levels are achieved with a limited level of segregation and exclusive lanes. Together with priority measures, holding strategies and timetables with sufficient recovery times are considered to contribute most to a stable operation. It is not expected that reliability can be significantly improved without a higher degree of segregation from the rest of the traffic. The results of this work provide a quantitative benchmark to which further improvements in the service can be compared. It can also prove useful to cities looking for ways to improve the reliability of their urban bus services. Further work will deal with the analysis of timetable design, buffer time allocation and holding strategies.},

To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory, based on coarse-grained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs, such as Pregel, and new applications that these models do not capture.

abstract = {Several decades of research on transit pricing have provided clear insights into how riders respond to price changes in both the transit and automobile sectors. For the most part, riders are insensitive to changes in either fare levels, structures, or forms of payments, though this varies considerably among user groups and operating environments. Since riders are approximately twice as sensitive to changes in travel time as they are to changes in fares, a compelling argument can be made for operating more premium quality transit services at higher prices. Such programs could be supplemented by vouchers and concessionary programs to reduce the burden of higher fares on love-income users. Also, cross-elasticity research suggests that higher automobile prices would have a significantly greater affect on ridership than lower fares. Most research on transit fare structures shows that the common practice of fiat fares is highly inequitable, penalizing short-distance and off-peak users. Free fare programs have proven quite costly for each new' transit user attracted and have rarely lured motorists to transit. Free fares limited to downtowns have been more successful than systemwide free fare programs. While prepayment schemes have met with success in the U.S. and Europe, honor fares h{\~{}},ve suffered from excessive revenue losses in at least one case in the U.S, Some of the more noteworthy fare policy successes in North America have been Bridgeport's combined pass-fare program, Allentown's deep discounts, Ottawa's major fare reduction and differentiation, and Columbus's substantial midday discount. As paratransit and other new transit alternatives to conventional bus continue to emerge, new, more differentiated fare practices can be expected in the future.},

We investigated the occurrence and diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems in 48 Bifidobacterium genomes to gain insights into the diversity and co-evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems within the genus and investigate CRISPR spacer content. We identified the elements necessary for the successful targeting and inference of foreign DNA in select Type II CRISPR-Cas systems, including the tracrRNA and target PAM sequence. Bifidobacterium species have a very high frequency of CRISPR-Cas occurrence (77{\%}, 37 of 48). We found that many Bifidobacterium species have unusually large and diverse CRISPR-Cas systems that contain spacer sequences showing homology to foreign genetic elements like prophages. A large number of CRISPR spacers in bifidobacteria show perfect homology to prophage sequences harbored in the chromosomes of other species of Bifidobacterium, including some spacers that self-target the chromosome. A correlation was observed between strains that lacked CRISPR-Cas systems and the number of times prophages in that chromosome were targeted by other CRISPR spacers. The presence of prophage-targeting CRISPR spacers and prophage content may shed light on evolutionary processes and strain divergence. Finally, elements of Type II CRISPR-Cas systems, including the tracrRNA and crRNAs, set the stage for the development of genome editing and genetic engineering tools.},

The probiotic effects of L. reuteri have been proposed to be largely associated with the production of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound reuterin during anaerobic metabolism of glycerol. We determined the complete genome sequences of the reuterin-producing L. reuteri JCM 1112(T) and its closely related species Lactobacillus fermentum IFO 3956. Both are in the same phylogenetic group within the genus Lactobacillus. Comparative genome analysis revealed that L. reuteri JCM 1112(T) has a unique cluster of 58 genes for the biosynthesis of reuterin and cobalamin (vitamin B(12)). The 58-gene cluster has a lower GC content and is apparently inserted into the conserved region, suggesting that the cluster represents a genomic island acquired from an anomalous source. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) with (13)C(3)-glycerol demonstrated that L. reuteri JCM 1112(T) could convert glycerol to reuterin in vivo, substantiating the potential of L. reuteri JCM 1112(T) to produce reuterin in the intestine. Given that glycerol is shown to be naturally present in feces, the acquired ability to produce reuterin and cobalamin is an adaptive evolutionary response that likely contributes to the probiotic properties of L. reuteri.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to compare the efficiency of conventional antibiotics in relation to hop-based antimicrobials, in industrial-scale production of bioethanol. The comparison was made by calculating the lactic acid bacteria population reduction in two consecutive fermentation cycles. The experiment used five treatments (three conventional antibiotics: Kamoran WP, Corstan and Alcapen 1030, and two hop-based antimicrobials: BetaBio and IsoStab). The samples were collected in the fermentation vat. In order to quantify the initial lactic acid bacteria population, a sample
was collected at the end of the fermentation process (wine) before the treatment with antibiotics or antimicrobials, and to determine the final population, the sample collection happened at the end of the fermentation process (wine) after the treatment with antibiotics
or antimicrobials. The experiment was completely randomized and the statistical analysis was performed through analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the transformed analysis y' = log (y + 1). After the data transformation, Levene's test was applied to verify the adherence of the data to the normal distribution, and the averages were compared through Tukey's test at 5{\%} probability. The results showed that the hop-based antimicrobials (IsoStab and BetaBio) can be used instead of the conventional antibiotics (Kamoran, Alcapen and Corstan), since there was no statistical difference between the treatments. },

Here, we have used a computational approach for quantification of bacteria in multispecies populations, generating data for time-series modeling. Moreover, we have used online FR-IR spectroscopy to monitor the main metabolic processes. The approach enabled us to provide a functional description of the parameters governing the population dynamics in a three-species model bacterial community, demonstrating density-dependent regulation, interspecies competition and even a case of cooperation between two species. Since the field of microbial ecology has yet to embrace many of the concepts and methods developed for the study of ecology of higher plants and animals, the realization that microbial systems can be analyzed within the same conceptual framework as other ecosystems is of fundamental importance.},

abstract = {Much research has been invested into engineering microorganisms to perform desired biotransformations; nonetheless, these efforts frequently fall short of expected results due to the unforeseen effects of biofeedback regulation and functional incompatibility. In nature, metabolic function is compartmentalized into diverse organisms assembled into robust consortia, in which the division of labor is thought to lead to increased community efficiency and productivity. Here we consider whether and how consortia can be designed to perform bioprocesses of interest beyond the metabolic flexibility limitations of a single organism. Advances in post-genomic analysis of microbial consortia and application of high-resolution global measurements now offer the promise of systems-level understanding of how microbial consortia adapt to changes in environmental variables and inputs of carbon and energy. We argue that, when combined with appropriate modeling frameworks, systems-level knowledge can markedly improve our ability to predict the fate and functioning of consortia. Here we articulate our collective perspective on the current and future state of microbial community engineering and control while placing specific emphasis on ecological principles that promote control over community function and emergent properties.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 11 March 2016; doi:10.1038/ismej.2016.26.},

abstract = {This study investigates, for the first time, the application of metabolic models incorporating polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) and glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) towards describing the biochemical transformations of full-scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). For this purpose, it was required to modify previous metabolic models applied to lab-scale systems by incorporating the anaerobic utilisation of the TCA cycle and the aerobic maintenance processes based on sequential utilisation of polyhydroxyalkanoates, followed by glycogen and polyphosphate. The abundance of the PAO and GAO populations quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation served as the initial conditions of each biomass fraction, whereby the models were able to describe accurately the experimental data. The kinetic rates were found to change among the four different WWTPs studied or even in the same plant during different seasons, either suggesting the presence of additional PAO or GAO organisms, or varying microbial activities for the same organisms. Nevertheless, these variations in kinetic rates were largely found to be proportional to the difference in acetate uptake rate, suggesting a viable means of calibrating the metabolic model. The application of the metabolic model to full-scale sludge also revealed that different Accumulibacter clades likely possess different acetate uptake mechanisms, as a correlation was observed between the energetic requirement for acetate transport across the cell membrane with the diversity of Accumulibacter present. Using the model as a predictive tool, it was shown that lower acetate concentrations in the feed as well as longer aerobic retention times favour the dominance of the TCA metabolism over glycolysis, which could explain why the anaerobic TCA pathway seems to be more relevant in full-scale WWTPs than in lab-scale systems.},

Numerically, the most frequent LAB isolates were Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (ca. 28{\%} of the total LAB isolates), Lactobacillus plantarum (ca. 16{\%}), and Lactobacillus paralimentarius (ca. 14{\%}). Saccharomyces cerevisiae was identified in 16 sourdoughs. Candida humilis, Kazachstania barnettii, and Kazachstania exigua were also identified. As shown by principal component analysis (PCA), a correlation was found between the ingredients, especially the type of flour, the microbial community, and the biochemical features of sourdoughs. Triticum durum flours were characterized by the high level of maltose, glucose, fructose, and free amino acids (FAA) correlated with the sole or main presence of obligately heterofermentative LAB, the lowest number of facultatively heterofermentative strains, and the low cell density of yeasts in the mature sourdoughs. This study highlighted, through a comprehensive and comparative approach, the dominant microbiotas of 19 Italian sourdoughs, which determined some of the peculiarities of the resulting traditional/typical Italian breads.},

However, the overall genome structure of this group of microorganisms remains largely unexplored. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 42 representative (sub)species across the Bifidobacterium genus and used this information to explore the overall genetic picture of this bacterial group. Furthermore, the genomic data described here were used to reconstruct the evolutionary development of the Bifidobacterium genus. This reconstruction suggests that its evolution was substantially influenced by genetic adaptations to obtain access to glycans, thereby representing a common and potent evolutionary force in shaping bifidobacterial genomes.},

These processes are characterized by the high contribution of sugar prices to the final production costs, by high production volumes, and by low profit margins. In this context, small improvements in the ethanol yield on sugars have a large impact on process economy. Three types of strategies used to achieve this goal are discussed: engineering free-energy conservation, engineering redox-metabolism, and decreasing sugar losses in the process. Whereas the two former strategies lead to decreased biomass and/or glycerol formation, the latter requires increased process and/or yeast robustness.},

abstract = {The gut microbiota is composed of a huge number of different bacteria, that produce a large amount of compounds playing a key role in microbe selection and in the construction of a metabolic signaling network. The microbial activities are affected by environmental stimuli leading to the generation of a wide number of compounds, that influence the host metabolome and human health. Indeed, metabolite profiles related to the gut microbiota can offer deep insights on the impact of lifestyle and dietary factors on chronic and acute diseases. Metagenomics, metaproteomics and metabolomics are some of the meta-omics approaches to study the modulation of the gut microbiota. Metabolomic research applied to biofluids allows to: define the metabolic profile; identify and quantify classes and compounds of interest; characterize small molecules produced by intestinal microbes; and define the biochemical pathways of metabolites. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are the principal technologies applied to metabolomics in terms of coverage, sensitivity and quantification. Moreover, the use of biostatistics and mathematical approaches coupled with metabolomics play a key role in the extraction of biologically meaningful information from wide datasets. Metabolomic studies in gut microbiota-related research have increased, focusing on the generation of novel biomarkers, which could lead to the development of mechanistic hypotheses potentially applicable to the development of nutritional and personalized therapies.},

abstract = {In recent years bioethanol has encompassed worldwide interest as a non-conventional bioenergy source. This fact has driven several bioethanol industries to produce more ethanol on a large scale via cost effective methods. However in the process of scaling up ethanol production bacterial contamination is becoming one of the more challenging problems facing the bioethanol industry. There are several traditional microbiological methods available to detect and subsequently limit these bacterial contaminants. These methods are time consuming, laborious and can be less sensitive. Consequently, it is necessary to find novel sensitive and economic detection methods to eradicate the contaminants long before they disrupt ethanol production. Molecular methods that can detect the contaminants even at very low numbers at any given stage would help in the design of more cost effective eradication strategies and better targeted antimicrobial treatments. Application of rapid molecular detection approaches have the potential to provide much more sensitive and rapid means to not only detect but quantitate microbial contaminants long before they become problematic to overall bioethanol formation.},

The B. longum plasmid pNAC1 was identified as being most closely related to pNAL8L (3.5 kb). However, DNA sequence analysis suggested that direct repeat-rich sites could have promoted several recombination events to diversify the two plasmid molecules. We verified the likely rolling circle replication of plasmid pNAL8L and studied the phylogenetic relationship in all the Bifidobacterium plasmids fully sequenced to date based on in silico comparative sequence analysis of their replication proteins and iteron regions. Our transformation experiments confirmed that the ColE1 replication origin from high-copy-number pUC vectors could interfere with the replication apparatus of Bifidobacterium plasmids and give rise to false positive clones. As a result, we developed a system suitable for avoiding possible interference by other functional replication modules on the vector and for screening functional replicons from wild-type plasmids.},

abstract = {Heating, cooling and lighting appliances in buildings account for more than one third of the world's primary energy demand and there are great potentials, which can be obtained through better applications of the energy use in buildings. In this regard, the building sector has a high potential for improving the quality match between energy supply and demand because high temperature sources are used to meet low-temperature heating needs. Low exergy (or LowEx) systems are defined as heating or cooling systems that allow the use of low valued energy, which is delivered by sustainable energy sources (i.e., through heat pumps, solar collectors, either separate or linked to waste heat, energy storage) as the energy source. These systems practically provide heating and cooling energy at a temperature close to room temperature while the so-called LowEx approach, which has been and still being successfully used in sustainable buildings design. The present study comprehensively reviews the studies conducted on LowEx heating and cooling systems for establishing the sustainable buildings. In this context, an introductory information is given first. Next, energy utilization and demand in buildings are summarized while various exergy definitions and sustainability aspects along with dead (reference) state are described. LowEx heating and cooling systems are then introduced. After that, LowEx relations used to estimate energy and exergy demand in buildings and key parameters for performance assessment and comparison purposes are presented. Finally, LowEx studies and applications conducted are reviewed while the last section concludes. The exergy efficiency values of the LowEx heating and cooling systems for buildings are obtained to range from 0.40{\%} to 25.3{\%} while those for greenhouses vary between 0.11{\%} and 11.5{\%}. The majority of analyses and assessments of LowEx systems are based on heating of buildings. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

So, while not ignoring$\backslash$nthe policy issues that will most certainly continue to shape the industry's trajectory in 2016 and$\backslash$nbeyond, this year's Outlook responds to a collective desire to return to the business of ethanol –$\backslash$none that has revitalized rural communities, created jobs in production, processing and marketing$\backslash$nacross the country, and provided consumer savings at the pump.$\backslash$nThe politics of ethanol may be rooted in its renewable, home-grown, and clean burning$\backslash$ncharacteristics. But the business of ethanol is rooted in octane. The world motor fuel market is$\backslash$nshort on octane, and ethanol is the lowest-cost source of octane available. Moreover, future growth$\backslash$nin the industry is quite likely tied directly to automaker efforts to meet increasingly stringent fuel$\backslash$neconomy standards with higher compression ratio engines that will require even higher octane fuels.$\backslash$nSo understanding the octane benefits of ethanol, particularly when compared to potential$\backslash$ncompetitors in the market, is critical to an appreciation for future challenges and opportunities$\backslash$nfacing the U.S. ethanol industry. These pages will provide an octane primer, along with a review of$\backslash$nethanol's place in the market today.$\backslash$nWhile 2015 was a far cry from 2014 in terms of profitability, last year was still another solid year$\backslash$nof growth in the face of falling oil prices and policy instability. Indeed, in November, the industry$\backslash$nhit the phenomenal production milestone of 1 million barrels per day! That's the equivalent of 15.3$\backslash$nbillion gallons on an annualized basis. The industry also saw DuPont open the world's largest$\backslash$ncellulosic ethanol production facility in Nevada, Iowa. Congratulations!$\backslash$nThe industry's commercial success only added to the frustration when EPA, on November 30,$\backslash$nfinalized an RFS rule that adopted the oil companies' narrative about the blend wall and reduced$\backslash$nthe 2016 RFS obligation for undifferentiated biofuels (corn ethanol) to 14.5 billion gallons, 800$\backslash$nmillion gallons less than our demonstrated production capability. Of course, the number was not$\backslash$nthe main issue. What EPA's rule really did was to fatally undermine the ability of the RFS's credit$\backslash$ntrading mechanism (RINs) to incentivize investment in the new technologies or infrastructure that$\backslash$nis necessary to fuel further market expansion. That is a drama that will most certainly continue to$\backslash$nimpact the legislative, regulatory, legal, and marketplace reality throughout 2016.

abstract = {Globally, bioethanol is the largest volume biofuel used in the transportation sector, with corn-based ethanol production occurring mostly in the US and sugarcane-based ethanol production occurring mostly in Brazil. Advances in technology and the resulting improved productivity in corn and sugarcane farming and ethanol conversion, together with biofuel policies, have contributed to the significant expansion of ethanol production in the past 20 years. These improvements have increased the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of using bioethanol as opposed to using petroleum gasoline. This article presents results from our most recently updated simulations of energy use and GHG emissions that result from using bioethanol made from several feedstocks. The results were generated with the GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation) model. In particular, based on a consistent and systematic model platform, we estimate life-cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions from using ethanol produced from five feedstocks: corn, sugarcane, corn stover, switchgrass and miscanthus. We quantitatively address the impacts of a few critical factors that affect life-cycle GHG emissions from bioethanol. Even when the highly debated land use change GHG emissions are included, changing from corn to sugarcane and then to cellulosic biomass helps to significantly increase the reductions in energy use and GHG emissions from using bioethanol. Relative to petroleum gasoline, ethanol from corn, sugarcane, corn stover, switchgrass and miscanthus can reduce life-cycle GHG emissions by 19–48{\%}, 40–62{\%}, 90–103{\%}, 77–97{\%} and 101–115{\%}, respectively. Similar trends have been found with regard to fossil energy benefits for the five bioethanol pathways.},

Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of Lactobacillus spp., alternative disinfection strategies are needed for ethanol fermenta-tions. The feasibility of using the bacteriophage (phage) 8014-B2 to control Lactobacillus plantarum in ethanol fermentations by Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated. In 48 h media-based shake flask fermentations, phages achieved greater than 3-log inactivation of L. plantarum, protected final ethanol yields, and maintained yeast viability. The phage-based bacterial disinfection rates depended on both the initial phage and bacterial concentrations. Furthermore, a simple set of kinetic equations was used to model the yeast, bacteria, phage, reducing sugars, and ethanol concentrations over the course of 48 h, and the various kinetic parameters were determined. Taken together, these results demonstrate the applicability of phages to reduce L. plantarum contamination and to protect final product yields in media-based fermentations.},

abstract = {The utilization of mixed consortia or mixed culture has become a current research trend of applied microbiology, bioprocess engineering and biotechnology. The constituent microorganisms of such mixed cultures can jointly perform complex processes efficiently, yielding the desired product at an augmented rate, in comparison to monocultures. It is understandable that the interactions between the microbial partners in these mixed cultures are expected to have a significant impact on the combined performance of the microorganisms and the bioprocess as a whole. Prevalence of positive interactions (commensalism or mutualism) among microbial members of a mixed culture or consortia can significantly enhance the product outcome of the bioprocess, ensuring their industrial application and long-term stability. On the contrary, negative interaction (parasitism, predation or ammensalism) leads to elimination of microbial members from the consortia causing the destruction of community structure as well as disruption of cumulative performance. Therefore, a priori knowledge on the type of interaction between the microorganisms is also essential for the optimization of the performance of the designed consortia. This could only be achieved through the study of inter-microbial interaction prevailing in a mixed culture. In the present article, different bioprocess applications of mixed cultures, currently in practice along with types of positive microbial interactions involved, have been reviewed. Complexity of mixed cultures from the perspective of multiple types of intra-culture relationships has been explained in detail. Overall, the necessity for more in-depth research studies on “microbial interaction” in mixed culture bioprocesses has been stressed in the article.},

abstract = {Contaminating microorganisms can be highly detrimental to the large-scale fermentation of complex low-cost feedstocks, such as sugarcane or dry-milled corn for biofuels or other industrial purposes. The challenge is that foreign organisms have to be inhibited without using antibiotics because of concerns about spreading antibiotic resistance. Shaw et al. engineered bacteria and yeast to use rare compounds as sources of nutrients (see the Perspective by Lennen). Engineering the common biocatalyst Escherichia coli, for example, to consume melamine as a nitrogen source allowed it to outcompete contaminating organisms. Similarly, engineering yeast to use cyanamide for nitrogen or phosphite for phosphorus also improved competitive fitness.Science, this issue p. 583; see also p. 542Microbial contamination is an obstacle to widespread production of advanced biofuels and chemicals. Current practices such as process sterilization or antibiotic dosage carry excess costs or encourage the development of antibiotic resistance. We engineered Escherichia coli to assimilate melamine, a xenobiotic compound containing nitrogen. After adaptive laboratory evolution to improve pathway efficiency, the engineered strain rapidly outcompeted a control strain when melamine was supplied as the nitrogen source. We additionally engineered the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica to assimilate nitrogen from cyanamide and phosphorus from potassium phosphite, and they outcompeted contaminating strains in several low-cost feedstocks. Supplying essential growth nutrients through xenobiotic or ecologically rare chemicals provides microbial competitive advantage with minimal external risks, given that engineered biocatalysts only have improved fitness within the customized fermentation environment.},

Fresh, unfermented cocoa beans are oval and weigh on average 2.5 g. The moisture content of the fresh beans is approximately 65{\%} (m/m). The initiation of cocoa bean fermentation corresponds with an incipient germination phase, which is necessary for hydration of bean components through water uptake by the protein vacuoles within the storage cells and mobilization of the radical enzymes. Biochemical and physical changes within the bean cotyledons can be divided into two broad phases: anaerobic hydrolytic phase and aerobic oxidative phase. It will be a challenge to introduce the application of starter cultures in cocoa bean fermentation practices, either to speed up and better control the fermentation process or to target the fermentation process towards predefined end-products.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Speech perception in adverse listening situations can be exhausting. Hearing loss particularly affects processing demands, as it requires increased effort for successful speech perception in background noise. Signal processing in hearing aids and noise reduction (NR) schemes aim to counteract the effect of noise and reduce the effort required for speech recognition in adverse listening situations. The present study examined the benefit of NR schemes, applying a combination of a digital NR and directional microphones, for reducing the processing effort during speech recognition. DESIGN: The effect of noise (intelligibility level) and different NR schemes on effort were evaluated by measuring the pupil dilation of listeners. In 2 different experiments, performance accuracy and peak pupil dilation (PPD) were measured in 24 listeners with hearing impairment while they performed a speech recognition task. The listeners were tested at 2 different signal to noise ratios corresponding to either the individual 50{\%} correct (L50) or the 95{\%} correct (L95) performance level in a 4-talker babble condition with and without the use of a NR scheme. RESULTS: In experiment 1, the PPD differed in response to both changes in the speech intelligibility level (L50 versus L95) and NR scheme. The PPD increased with decreasing intelligibility, indicating higher processing effort under the L50 condition compared with the L95 condition. Moreover, the PPD decreased when the NR scheme was applied, suggesting that the processing effort was reduced. In experiment 2, 2 hearing aids using different NR schemes (fast-acting and slow-acting) were compared. Processing effort changed as indicated by the PPD depending on the hearing aids and therefore on the NR scheme. Larger PPDs were measured for the slow-acting NR scheme. CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of applying an NR scheme was demonstrated for both L50 and L95, that is, a situation at which the performance level was at a ceiling. This opens the opportunity for new means of evaluating hearing aids in situations in which traditional speech reception measures are shown not to be sensitive.},

abstract = {The healthy microbiota show remarkable variability within and among individuals. In addition to external exposures, ecological relationships (both oppositional and symbiotic) between microbial inhabitants are important contributors to this variation. It is thus of interest to assess what relationships might exist among microbes and determine their underlying reasons. The initial Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort, comprising 239 individuals and 18 different microbial habitats, provides an unprecedented resource to detect, catalog, and analyze such relationships. Here, we applied an ensemble method based on multiple similarity measures in combination with generalized boosted linear models (GBLMs) to taxonomic marker (16S rRNA gene) profiles of this cohort, resulting in a global network of 3,005 significant co-occurrence and co-exclusion relationships between 197 clades occurring throughout the human microbiome. This network revealed strong niche specialization, with most microbial associations occurring within body sites and a number of accompanying inter-body site relationships. Microbial communities within the oropharynx grouped into three distinct habitats, which themselves showed no direct influence on the composition of the gut microbiota. Conversely, niches such as the vagina demonstrated little to no decomposition into region-specific interactions. Diverse mechanisms underlay individual interactions, with some such as the co-exclusion of Porphyromonaceae family members and Streptococcus in the subgingival plaque supported by known biochemical dependencies. These differences varied among broad phylogenetic groups as well, with the Bacilli and Fusobacteria, for example, both enriched for exclusion of taxa from other clades. Comparing phylogenetic versus functional similarities among bacteria, we show that dominant commensal taxa (such as Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides in the gut) often compete, while potential pathogens (e.g. Treponema and Prevotella in the dental plaque) are more likely to co-occur in complementary niches. This approach thus serves to open new opportunities for future targeted mechanistic studies of the microbial ecology of the human microbiome.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Food supplemented with probiotic bacteria is a rapidly growing sector of the market. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the acid production of selected probiotic strains available in commercial products. METHODS: Six Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and 931; Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and LB21; Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei F19, and Lactobacillus reuteri PTA 5289) were cultivated at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere on Man, Rogosa, Shape (MRS) agar for 48 h or MRS broth for 16 h. After centrifugation, the cells were washed and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and immediately subjected to a fermentation assay with 12 different carbohydrates (nine sugars and three sugar alcohols) in microtiter plates with a pH indicator. The plates were examined for color changes after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Three scores were used: negative (pH {\textgreater} 6.8); weak (pH 5.2-6.8), and positive (pH {\textless} 5.2). The strains were characterized with the API 50 CH system to confirm their identity. RESULTS: L. plantarum fermented all the sugars except for melibiose, raffinose, and xylitol. Both L. rhamnosus strains were generally less active although L. rhamnosus GG was slightly more active than strain LB21 in the 5{\%} CO(2) setting. The latter strain exhibited negative reactions for sucrose, maltose, arabinose, and sorbitol under anaerobic conditions. The assays with L. paracasei and L. reuteri had negative or weak reactions for all tested sugars under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. CONCLUSION: The metabolic capacity to form acid from dietary sugars differed significantly between the various probiotic strains.},

One of the methods of their removal from soil is bioaugmentation, defined as a technique for improvement of the degradative capacity of contaminated areas by introduction of specific competent strains or consortia of microorganisms. The efficiency of bioaugmentation is determined by many abiotic and biotic factors discussed in this paper. The first include chemical structure, concentration and availability of pollutants as well as physico-chemical properties of soil. In turn, among biotic factors the most important is the selection of proper microorganisms that can not only degrade contaminants but can also successfully compete with indigenous microflora.Several strategies are being developed to make augmentation a successful technology particularly in soils without degrading indigenous microorganisms. These approaches involve the use of genetically engineered microorganisms and gene bioaugmentation.

This model predicts that DNA attaches to the cell wall and enters the cell via endocytotic membrane invagination, although how DNA reaches the nucleus is unknown. Polyethylene glycol is indispensable for successful transformation of intact cells and the attachment of DNA and also possibly acts on the membrane to increase the transformation efficiency.

We represent the structural boundary by a level set model that is embedded in a scalar function of a higher dimension. Such level set models are flexible in handling complex topological changes and are concise in describing the boundary shape of the structure. Furthermore, a well-founded mathematical procedure leads to a numerical algorithm that describes a structural optimization as a sequence of motions of the implicit boundaries converging to an optimum solution and satisfying specified constraints. The result is a 3D topology optimization technique that demonstrates outstanding flexibility of handling topological changes, fidelity of boundary representation and degree of automation. We have implemented the algorithm with the use of several robust and efficient numerical techniques of level set methods. The benefit and the advantages of the proposed method are illustrated with several 2D examples that are widely used in the recent literature of topology optimization, especially in the homogenization based methods.},

abstract = {Distinct microbial ecosystems have evolved to meet the challenges of indoor environments, shaping the microbial communities that interact most with modern human activities. Microbial transmission in food-processing facilities has an enormous impact on the qualities and healthfulness of foods, beneficially or detrimentally interacting with food products. To explore modes of microbial transmission and spoilage-gene frequency in a commercial food-production scenario, we profiled hop-resistance gene frequencies and bacterial and fungal communities in a brewery. We employed a Bayesian approach for predicting routes of contamination, revealing critical control points for microbial management. Physically mapping microbial populations over time illustrates patterns of dispersal and identifies potential contaminant reservoirs within this environment. Habitual exposure to beer is associated with increased abundance of spoilage genes, predicting greater contamination risk. Elucidating the genetic landscapes of indoor environments poses important practical implications for food-production systems and these concepts are translatable to other built environments.},

abstract = {We develop a fast method to localize the level set method of Osher and Sethian (1988, J. Comput. Phys.79, 12) and address two important issues that are intrinsic to the level set method: (a) how to extend a quantity that is given only on the interface to a neighborhood of the interface; (b) how to reset the level set function to be a signed distance function to the interface efficiently without appreciably moving the interface. This fast local level set method reduces the computational effort by one order of magnitude, works in as much generality as the original one, and is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Our approach differs from previous related works in that we extract all the information needed from the level set function (or functions in multiphase flow) and do not need to find explicitly the location of the interface in the space domain. The complexity of our method to do tasks such as extension and distance reinitialization is O(N), where N is the number of points in space, not O(N log N) as in works by Sethian (1996, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 93, 1591) and Helmsen and co-workers (1996, SPIE Microlithography IX, p. 253). This complexity estimation is also valid for quite general geometrically based front motion for our localized method.},

abstract = {The topology description function (TDF) approach is a method for describing geometries in a discrete fashion, i.e. without intermediate densities. Hence, the TDF approach may be used to carry out topology optimization, i.e. to solve the material distribution problem. However, the material distribution problem may be ill-posed. This ill-posedness can be avoided by limiting the complexity of the design, which is accomplished automatically by limiting the number of design parameters used for the TDF. An important feature is that the TDF design description is entirely decoupled from a finite element (FE) model. The basic idea of the TDF approach is as follows. In the TDF approach, the design variables are parameters that determine a function on the so-called reference domain. Using a cut-off level, this function unambiguously determines a geometry. Then, the performance of this geometry is determined by a FE analysis. Several optimization techniques are applied to the TDF approach to carry out topology optimization. First, a genetic algorithm is applied, with (too) large computational costs. The TDF approach is shown to work using a heuristic iterative adaptation of the design parameters. For more effective and sound optimization methods, design sensitivities are required. The first results on design sensitivity analysis are presented, and their accuracy is studied. Numerical examples are provided for illustration.},

Moreover, the strain presented a strong tolerance at the inhibitory effect of the 1,3-propanediol, even at high concentrations of this substance at the chemostat (e.g. 80 g l-1). 1,3-Propanediol was associated with cell growth whereas acetate and butyrate seemed non growth-associated products. At low and medium dilution rates (until 0.1 h-1), butyrate production was favoured, whereas at higher rates acetate production increased. The maximum 1,3-propanediol volumetric productivity obtained was 5.5 g l-1 h-1. A two-stage continuous fermentation was also carried out. The first stage presented high 1,3-propanediol volumetric productivity, whereas the second stage (with a lower dilution rate) served to further increase the final product concentration. High 1,3-propanediol concentrations were achieved (41-46 g l-1), with a maximum volumetric productivity of 3.4 g l-1 h-1. A cell concentration decrease was reported between the second and the first fermentor.},

Recent efforts have characterized the diversity of this host-associated community, but it remains unclear which microorganisms are active and what perturbations influence this activity. Here, we combine flow cytometry, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and metatranscriptomics to demonstrate that the gut contains a distinctive set of active microorganisms, primarily Firmicutes. Short-term exposure to a panel of xenobiotics significantly affected the physiology, structure, and gene expression of this active gut microbiome. Xenobiotic-responsive genes were found across multiple bacterial phyla, encoding antibiotic resistance, drug metabolism, and stress response pathways. These results demonstrate the power of moving beyond surveys of microbial diversity to better understand metabolic activity, highlight the unintended consequences of xenobiotics, and suggest that attempts at personalized medicine should consider interindividual variations in the active human gut microbiome.

abstract = {Comparative metabolic modelling is emerging as a novel field, supported by the development of reliable and standardized approaches for constructing genome-scale metabolic models in high throughput. New software solutions are needed to allow efficient comparative analysis of multiple models in the context of multiple cellular objectives. Here, we present the user-friendly software framework Multi-Metabolic Evaluator (MultiMetEval), built upon SurreyFBA, which allows the user to compose collections of metabolic models that together can be subjected to flux balance analysis. Additionally, MultiMetEval implements functionalities for multi-objective analysis by calculating the Pareto front between two cellular objectives. Using a previously generated dataset of 38 actinobacterial genome-scale metabolic models, we show how these approaches can lead to exciting novel insights. Firstly, after incorporating several pathways for the biosynthesis of natural products into each of these models, comparative flux balance analysis predicted that species like Streptomyces that harbour the highest diversity of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in their genomes do not necessarily have the metabolic network topology most suitable for compound overproduction. Secondly, multi-objective analysis of biomass production and natural product biosynthesis in these actinobacteria shows that the well-studied occurrence of discrete metabolic switches during the change of cellular objectives is inherent to their metabolic network architecture. Comparative and multi-objective modelling can lead to insights that could not be obtained by normal flux balance analyses. MultiMetEval provides a powerful platform that makes these analyses straightforward for biologists.

In a complex medium containing yeast extract and peptone, only glycerol, d-fructose, and meso-inositol contributed to growth, whereas other hexoses, pentoses, polyols, polysaccharides, and organic acids were inactive. Glycerol and fructose were inhibitory to GS formation; inositol had no effect. In chemically defined media containing a mixture of five amino acids (glutamine, methionine, proline, arginine, and histidine) necessary for good growth, again only glycerol, d-fructose, and meso-inositol served as effective carbon sources for growth. With respect to antibiotic formation, inositol was much poorer than glycerol or fructose. In the presence of glycerol and the five amino acids, addition of 0.1{\%} l-phenylalanine specifically stimulated GS production. Growth kinetics in this defined medium showed two phases: early and rapid growth at the expense of the amino acid mixture, followed by glycerol utilization after a diauxic lag of 2 to 3 h; inositol utilization suffered a much longer lag period. GS formation was initiated after the diauxic lag. Ammonium sulfate was the best individual nitrogen source, but the combination of the five growth-stimulatory amino acids was more potent for GS production. The level of potassium phosphate influenced GS production. High levels stimulated the growth rate but progressively inhibited GS production. Methionine was the best sulfur source. A defined medium (F3/6) that supported rapid exponential growth (mu = 0.53 h(-1)) followed by progressively slower growth over a 30- to 40-h period was devised containing fructose, six amino acids, and mineral salts. GS formation was initiated as the cells left the exponential growth phase and reached high levels (1,500 mg of GS per liter; 0.19 mg of GS/mg of dry cell weight) after 40 to 50 h of incubation.},

Using our genome engineering vector suite, single and triple insertions are obtained with 90-100{\%} and 60-70{\%} targeting efficiency, respectively. We demonstrate application of the vector toolkit by constructing a haploid laboratory strain (CEN.PK113-7D) and a diploid industrial strain (Ethanol Red) for production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid, where we tested three different acetyl-CoA supply strategies, requiring overexpression of three to six genes each. Among the tested strategies was a bacterial cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which was integrated into the genome in a single transformation. The publicly available EasyClone-MarkerFree vector suite allows for facile and highly standardized genome engineering, and should be of particular interest to researchers working on yeast chassis with limited markers available.},

abstract = {Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are an advanced technology for wastewater treatment whose wide application has been hindered by rapid fouling of the membranes. MBRs can be operated with long sludge retention time (SRT), a crucial parameter impacting microbial selection in the reactor. This also affects filtration performance, since a major fouling agent are the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). In this study, the impact of the SRT on the ecophysiology of the MBRs and, consequently, on membrane fouling was evaluated. A MBR was operated under a SRT of 60 days followed by a SRT of 20 days. A comprehensive analysis of the microbial community structure and EPS proteins and polysaccharide profiles of the mixed liquor and cake layer was carried out throughout both operation periods. The results of this study showed that the imposition of a shorter SRT led to a shift in the dominant bacterial populations. The mixed liquor and cake layer communities were very different, with Actinomycetales order standing out in the cake layer at SRT of 20 days. Overall, higher EPS concentrations (particularly proteins) were found at this SRT. Furthermore, EPS profiles were clearly affected by the SRT: it was possible to correlate a group of soluble EPS proteins with the SRT of 60 days, and a lower sludge age led to a lower diversity of polysaccharide sugar monomers, with an increase of glucose and galactose in the cake layer. This study improves our knowledge regarding the molecular reasons for fouling, which may contribute to improve MBR design and operation.},

abstract = {Explorations of complex microbiomes using genomics greatly enhance our understanding about their diversity, biogeography, and function. The isolation of DNA from microbiome specimens is a key prerequisite for such examinations, but challenges remain in obtaining sufficient DNA quantities required for certain sequencing approaches, achieving accurate genomic inference of microbiome composition, and facilitating comparability of findings across specimen types and sequencing projects. These aspects are particularly relevant for the genomics-based global surveillance of infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance from different reservoirs. Here, we compare a total of eight DNA extraction procedures for three specimen types (human feces, pig feces, hospital sewage), assess DNA extraction using spike-in controls and different types of beads for bead-beating facilitating cell lysis. We evaluate DNA concentration, purity, and stability, and microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and for selected samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results suggest that inferred community composition was dependent on inherent specimen properties as well as DNA extraction method. We further show that bead-beating or enzymatic treatment can increase the extraction of DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Final DNA quantities could be increased by isolating DNA from a larger volume of cell lysate compared to standard protocols. Based on this insight, we have designed an improved DNA isolation procedure optimized for microbiome genomics that can be used for the three examined specimen types and potentially also for other biological specimens.},

However, compelling scientific evidence from in vivo infection studies is lacking. Therefore, we studied the effect of several non-digestible carbohydrates on the resistance of rats to Salmonella enteritidis infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Rats (n=8 per group) were fed "humanised" purified diets containing 4{\%} lactulose, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), resistant starch, wheat fibre, or cellulose. After an adaptation period of 2 weeks the animals were orally infected with S enteritidis. Supplement induced changes in faecal biochemical and microbiological parameters were studied before infection. Colonisation of salmonella was determined by studying the faecal excretion of this pathogen and translocation by analysis of urinary nitric oxide metabolites over time and classical organ cultures. Intestinal mucosal myeloperoxidase activity was determined to quantify intestinal inflammation after infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Despite stimulation of intestinal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and inhibition of salmonella colonisation, FOS and lactulose significantly enhanced translocation of this pathogen. These supplements also increased cytotoxicity of faecal water and faecal mucin excretion, which may reflect mucosal irritation. In addition, caecal and colonic, but not ileal, mucosal myeloperoxidase activity was increased in infected rats fed FOS and lactulose. In contrast, cellulose, wheat fibre, and resistant starch did not affect the resistance to salmonella.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In contrast to most expectations, FOS and lactulose impair the resistance of rats to intestinal salmonella infection. Obviously, stimulation of the endogenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria is no guarantee of improved host defence against intestinal infections.},

abstract = {The cryopreservation of mammalian embryos has expanded over the past 20 yr by encompassing a range of sophisticated methods to deal with different developmental stages and different sensitivities to low-temperature exposure. We have described a method for slow, controlled-rate freezing of early stage embryos based on exposure to 1,2-propanediol and sucrose, while the method for late-stage (blastocyst) embryos employs mixtures of glycerol and sucrose. Both methods have been used for animal and human embryos. A third rapid cooling or "vitrification" technique is described, which depends on brief but controlled exposure of multicellular embryos to mixtures of glycerol and 1,2-propanediol at high concentrations. This technique is used for successful animal embryo cryopreservation but is not yet widely applied in the clinic.},

@article{Geiss2012,
abstract = {This paper presents a level-set-based topology optimization method based on numerically consistent sensitivity analysis. The proposed method uses a direct steepest-descent update of the design variables in a level-set method; the level-set nodal values. An exact Heaviside formulation is used to relate the level-set function to element densities. The level-set function is not required to be a signed-distance function, and reinitialization is not necessary. Using this approach, level-set-based topology optimization problems can be solved consistently and multiple constraints treated simultaneously. The proposed method leads to more insight in the nature of level-set-based topology optimization problems. The level-set-based design parametrization can describe gray areas and numerical hinges. Consis- tency causes results to contain these numerical artifacts.We demonstrate that alternative parameterizations, level-set-based or density-based regularization can be used to avoid artifacts in the final results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using several benchmark problems. The capa- bility to treat multiple constraints shows the potential of the method. Furthermore, due to the consistency, the optimizer can run into local minima; a fundamental difficulty of level-set-based topology optimization. More advanced optimization strategies and more efficient optimizers may increase the performance in the future. Copyright},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which the weak acid preservative benzoic acid inhibits the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been investigated. A reduction in the pyruvate kinase level, which decreases glycolytic flux, did not increase the sensitivity of yeast to benzoic acid. However, a decrease in 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PF1K), which does not affect glycolytic flux, did increase sensitivity to benzoic acid. Also, resistance was increased by elevating PF1K levels. Hence, resistance to benzoic acid was not dependent upon optimum glycolytic flux, but upon an adequate PF1K activity. Benzoic acid was shown to depress fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels in YKC14, a mutant with low PF1K levels. This effect was partially suppressed by overexpressing constitutively active 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (Pfk26(Asp644)) or by inactivating fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (in a Deltafbp26 mutant). The inactivation of PF2K (in a Deltapfk26 Deltapfk27 mutant) increased benzoic acid sensitivity. Therefore, the antimicrobial effects of benzoic acid can be relieved, at least in part, by the genetic manipulation of PF1K or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels.},

abstract = {The exploration of microbiomes in lymphatic organs is relevant for basic and applied research into explaining microbial translocation processes and understanding cross-contamination during slaughter. This study aimed to investigate whether metabolically active bacteria (MAB) could be detected within tonsils and mandibular lymph nodes (MLNs) of pigs. The hypervariable V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes was amplified from cDNA from tonsils and MLNs of eight clinically healthy slaughter pigs. Pyrosequencing yielded 82,857 quality-controlled sequences, clustering into 576 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which were assigned to 230 genera and 16 phyla. The actual number of detected OTUs per sample varied highly (23-171 OTUs). Prevotella zoogleoformans and Serratia proteamaculans (best type strain hits) were most abundant (10.6 and 41.8{\%}, respectively) in tonsils and MLNs, respectively. To explore bacterial correlation patterns between samples of each tissue, pairwise Spearman correlations (r s) were calculated. In total, 194 strong positive and negative correlations |r s| ≥ 0.6 were found. We conclude that (i) lymphatic organs harbor a high diversity of MAB, (ii) the occurrence of viable bacteria in lymph nodes is not restricted to pathological processes and (iii) lymphatic tissues may serve as a contamination source in pig slaughterhouses. This study confirms the necessity of the EFSA regulation with regard to a meat inspection based on visual examinations to foster a minimization of microbial contamination.},

The PhyloChip microarray was used to investigate bacterial diversity and community composition in three Australian sugar cane processing plants. These ecosystems were highly complex and dominated by four main Phyla, Firmicutes (the most dominant), followed by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi. Significant variation (p {\textless} 0.05) in community structure occurred between samples collected from 'floor dump sediment', 'cooling tower water', and 'bagasse leachate'. Many bacterial Classes contributed to these differences, however most were of low numerical abundance. Separation in community composition was also linked to Classes of Firmicutes, particularly Bacillales, Lactobacillales and Clostridiales, whose dominance is likely to be linked to their physiology as 'lactic acid bacteria', capable of fermenting the sugars present. This process may help displace other bacterial taxa, providing a competitive advantage for Firmicutes bacteria.},

Bio-ethanol is by far the most widely used bio-fuel for transportation worldwide. Production of bio-ethanol from biomass is one way to reduce both consumption of crude oil and environmental pollution. Using bio-ethanol blended gasoline fuel for automobiles can significantly reduce petroleum use and exhaust greenhouse gas emission. Bio-ethanol can be produced from different kinds of raw materials. These raw materials are classified into three categories of agricultural raw materials: simple sugars, starch and lignocellulose. Bio-ethanol from sugar cane, produced under the proper conditions, is essentially a clean fuel and has several clear advantages over petroleum-derived gasoline in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality in metropolitan areas. Conversion technologies for producing bio-ethanol from cellulosic biomass resources such as forest materials, agricultural residues and urban wastes are under development and have not yet been demonstrated commercially. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Little is known about the archaeal diversity of fermented seafood; most of the earlier studies of fermented food have focused on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the fermentation process. In this study, the archaeal and bacterial diversity in seven kinds of fermented seafood were culture-independently examined using barcoded pyrosequencing and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) methods. The multiplex barcoded pyrosequencing was performed in a single run, with multiple samples tagged uniquely by multiplex identifiers, using different primers for Archaea or Bacteria. Because PCR-DGGE analysis is a conventional molecular ecological approach, this analysis was also performed on the same samples and the results were compared with the results of the barcoded pyrosequencing analysis. A total of 13 372 sequences were retrieved from 15 898 pyrosequencing reads and were analyzed to evaluate the diversity of the archaeal and bacterial populations in seafood. The most predominant types of archaea and bacteria identified in the samples included extremely halophilic archaea related to the family Halobacteriaceae; various uncultured mesophilic Crenarchaeota, including Crenarchaeota Group I.1 (CG I.1a and CG I.1b), Marine Benthic Group B (MBG-B), and Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (MCG); and LAB affiliated with genus Lactobacillus and Weissella. Interestingly, numerous uncultured mesophilic Crenarchaeota groups were as ubiquitous in the fermented seafood as in terrestrial and aquatic niches; the existence of these Crenarchaeota groups has not been reported in any fermented food. These results indicate that the archaeal populations in the fermented seafood analyzed are diverse and include the halophilic and mesophilic groups, and that barcoded pyrosequencing is a promising and cost-effective method for analyzing microbial diversity compared with conventional approaches.},

Most microbiological studies on kimchi have been on the most popular dish, baechu-kimchi (Chinese cabbage kimchi). Therefore, relatively little is known about the various other kinds of kimchi (depending on the region, season, main ingredient, starter culture inoculation and recipe). In this study, we collected 100 samples periodically during the fermentation of ten representative kinds of kimchi (including starter-inoculated kimchi) that were stored in the refrigerator (4??C) during the 30-35 days fermentation period. The multiplex barcoded pyrosequencing of a hypervariable V1-V3 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene tagged with sample-specific barcodes for multiplex identifiers was employed for bacterial community profiling. We found that bacterial communities differed between starter-inoculated and non-inoculated kimchi at the early stages of fermentation, but overall there were no significant differences in the late phases. Also, the diversity and richness of bacterial communities varied depending on the various types of kimchi, and these differences could largely be explained by the major ingredients and the manufacture processes of each types of kimchi. This study provides the comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the biodiversity of the kimchi ecosystem. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Conventional pure culture-oriented cultivation does not account for these interactions mediated by small molecules, which severely limits its utility in cultivating and studying ''unculturable'' microorganisms from synergistic communities. In this study, we developed a simple microfluidic device for highly parallel co-cultivation of symbiotic microbial communities and demonstrated its effectiveness in discovering synergistic interactions among microbes. Using aqueous micro-droplets dispersed in a continuous oil phase, the device could readily encapsulate and co-cultivate subsets of a community. A large number of droplets, up to ,1,400 in a 10 mm65 mm chamber, were generated with a frequency of 500 droplets/sec. A synthetic model system consisting of cross-feeding E. coli mutants was used to mimic compositions of symbionts and other microbes in natural microbial communities. Our device was able to detect a pair-wise symbiotic relationship when one partner accounted for as low as 1{\%} of the total population or each symbiont was about 3{\%} of the artificial community.},

PE-2 displayed a remarkably higher fitness than CEN.PK113-7D during batch cultivation on complex Yeast extract - Peptone - Dextrose medium at low pH (2.7). Kinetics of viability loss of non-growing cells, incubated at pH 1.5, indicated a superior survival of glucose-depleted PE-2 cells, when compared with either CEN.PK113-7D or a commercial bakers' strain. These results indicate that the sulfuric acid washing step, used in the fuel ethanol industry to decrease bacterial contamination due to non-aseptic operation, might have exerted an important selective pressure on the microbial populations present in such environments.},

@article{OSullivan2015,
abstract = {The human brain has evolved to operate effectively in highly complex acoustic environments, segregating multiple sound sources into perceptually distinct auditory objects. A recent theory seeks to explain this ability by arguing that stream segregation occurs primarily due to the temporal coherence of the neural populations that encode the various features of an individual acoustic source. This theory has received support from both psychoacoustic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that use stimuli which model complex acoustic environments. Termed stochastic figure-ground (SFG) stimuli, they are composed of a "figure" and background that overlap in spectrotemporal space, such that the only way to segregate the figure is by computing the coherence of its frequency components over time. Here, we extend these psychoacoustic and fMRI findings by using the greater temporal resolution of electroencephalography to investigate the neural computation of temporal coherence. We present subjects with modified SFG stimuli wherein the temporal coherence of the figure is modulated stochastically over time, which allows us to use linear regression methods to extract a signature of the neural processing of this temporal coherence. We do this under both active and passive listening conditions. Our findings show an early effect of coherence during passive listening, lasting from 115 to 185 ms post-stimulus. When subjects are actively listening to the stimuli, these responses are larger and last longer, up to 265 ms. These findings provide evidence for early and preattentive neural computations of temporal coherence that are enhanced by active analysis of an auditory scene.},

abstract = {Evolution of large asexual cell populations underlies ∼30{\%} of deaths worldwide, including those caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and cancer. However, the dynamics underlying these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because they involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never rise above extremely low frequencies in the population. To observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor the relative frequencies of ∼500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic effects become important.},

abstract = {The relative abundance of transcripts encoding proteins involved in inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCM), detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and photosynthesis in the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus OS-B' was measured in hot spring microbial mats over two diel cycles, and was coupled with in situ determinations of incoming irradiance and microenvironmental dynamics of O(2) and pH. Fluctuations in pH and O(2) in the mats were largely driven by the diel cycle of solar irradiance, with a pH variation from ∼7.0 to ∼9.5, and O(2) levels ranging from anoxia to supersaturation during night and day, respectively. Levels of various transcripts from mat cyanobacteria revealed several patterns that correlated with incident irradiance, O(2) and pH within the mat matrix. Transcript abundances for most genes increased during the morning dark-light transition. Some transcripts remained at a near constant level throughout the light period, whereas others showed an additional increase in abundance as the mat underwent transition from low-to-high light (potentially reflecting changes in O(2) concentration and pH), followed by either a decreased abundance in the early afternoon, or a gradual decline during the early afternoon and into the evening. One specific transcipt, psbA1, was the lowest during mid-day under high irradiance and increased when the light levels declined. We discuss these complex in situ transcriptional patterns with respect to environmental and endogenous cues that might impact and regulate transcription over the diel cycle.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae displays very strong induction of a single ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, Pdr12p, when stressed with certain weak organic acids. This is a plasma membrane pump catalysing active efflux of the organic acid anion from the cell. Pdr12p action probably allows S. cerevisiae to maintain lower intracellular levels of several weak organic acid preservatives than would be expected on the basis of the free equilibration of the acid across the cell membrane. This in turn facilitates growth in the presence of these preservatives and therefore yeast spoilage of food materials. Pdr12p appears to confer resistance to those carboxylic acids that, to a reasonable degree, partition into both the lipid bilayer and aqueous phases. Its gene (PDR12) is strongly induced by sorbate, benzoate and certain other moderately lipophilic carboxylate compounds, but not by organic alcohols or high levels of acetate. PDR12 induction reflects the operation of a previously uncharacterized S. cerevisiae stress response, for which the induction signal is probably a high intracellular pool of the organic acid anion.},

Huge research efforts have been spent in order to solve this problem, but additional ways must still be found to keep bacterial contaminants from thriving in these environments. The aim of this project was to develop process conditions that would inhibit bacterial growth while giving yeast a competitive advantage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Lactic acid bacteria are usually considered to be the most common contaminants in industrial yeast fermentations. Our observations support this view but also suggest that acetic acid bacteria, although not so numerous, could be a much more problematic obstacle to overcome. Acetic acid bacteria showed a capacity to drastically reduce the viability of yeast. In addition, they consumed the previously formed ethanol. Lactic acid bacteria did not show this detrimental effect on yeast viability. It was possible to combat both types of bacteria by a combined addition of NaCl and ethanol to the wood hydrolysate medium used. As a result of NaCl + ethanol additions the amount of viable bacteria decreased and yeast viability was enhanced concomitantly with an increase in ethanol concentration. The successful result obtained via addition of NaCl and ethanol was also confirmed in a real industrial ethanol production plant with its natural inherent yeast/bacterial community.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: It is possible to reduce the number of bacteria and offer a selective advantage to yeast by a combined addition of NaCl and ethanol when cultivated in lignocellulosic medium such as wood hydrolysate. However, for optimal results, the concentrations of NaCl + ethanol must be adjusted to suit the challenges offered by each hydrolysate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus reuteri metabolizes glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) and further to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO), the latter step catalysed by a propanediol dehydrogenase (PDH). The last step in this pathway regenerates NAD+ and enables therefore the energetically more favourable production of acetate over ethanol during growth on glucose.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A search throughout the genome of L. reuteri DSM 20016 revealed two putative PDHs encoded by ORFs lr{\_}0030 and lr{\_}1734. ORF lr{\_}1734 is situated in the pdu operon encoding the glycerol conversion machinery and therefore likely involved in 1,3-PDO formation. ORF lr{\_}0030 has not been associated with PDH-activity so far. To elucidate the role of these two PDHs, gene deletion mutant strains were constructed. Growth behaviour on glucose was comparable between the wild type and both mutant strains. However, on glucose + glycerol, the exponential growth rate of $\Delta$lr{\_}0030 was lower compared to the wild type and the lr{\_}1734 mutant. Furthermore, glycerol addition resulted in decreased ethanol production in the wild type and $\Delta$lr{\_}1734, but not in $\Delta$lr{\_}0030. PDH activity measurements using 3-HPA as a substrate revealed lower activity of $\Delta$lr{\_}0030 extracts from exponential growing cells compared to wild type and $\Delta$lr{\_}1734 extracts.During biotechnological 3-HPA production using non-growing cells, the ratio 3-HPA to 1,3-PDO was approximately 7 in the wild type and $\Delta$lr{\_}0030, whereas this ratio was 12.5 in the mutant $\Delta$lr{\_}1734.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The enzyme encoded by lr{\_}0030 plays a pivotal role in 3-HPA conversion in exponential growing L. reuteri cells. The enzyme encoded by lr{\_}1734 is active during 3-HPA production by non-growing cells and this enzyme is a useful target to enhance 3-HPA production and minimize formation of the by-product 1,3-PDO.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because protonation affects the properties of almost all molecules in cells, cytosolic pH (pH(c)) is usually assumed to be constant. In the model organism yeast, however, pH(c) changes in response to the presence of nutrients and varies during growth. Since small changes in pH(c) can lead to major changes in metabolism, signal transduction, and phenotype, we decided to analyze pH(c) control.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Introducing a pH-sensitive reporter protein into the yeast deletion collection allowed quantitative genome-wide analysis of pH(c) in live, growing yeast cultures. pH(c) is robust towards gene deletion; no single gene mutation led to a pH(c) of more than 0.3 units lower than that of wild type. Correct pH(c) control required not only vacuolar proton pumps, but also strongly relied on mitochondrial function. Additionally, we identified a striking relationship between pH(c) and growth rate. Careful dissection of cause and consequence revealed that pH(c) quantitatively controls growth rate. Detailed analysis of the genetic basis of this control revealed that the adequate signaling of pH(c) depended on inositol polyphosphates, a set of relatively unknown signaling molecules with exquisitely pH sensitive properties.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: While pH(c) is a very dynamic parameter in the normal life of yeast, genetically it is a tightly controlled cellular parameter. The coupling of pH(c) to growth rate is even more robust to genetic alteration. Changes in pH(c) control cell division rate in yeast, possibly as a signal. Such a signaling role of pH(c) is probable, and may be central in development and tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {The Brazilian sugar cane industry constitute one of the biggest and most efficient ethanol production platforms in the world. Brazilian ethanol production utilizes a unique process, which include cell recycling, acid wash and aseptic conditions. Features such as extensive CO2 generation, crude composition of the substrate and frequent contaminations, leads to excessive foam formation during the fermentations that is treated with chemical antifoaming agents (AFAs). This study has investigated the impact of AFA treatments on the physiology and transcriptome of the industrial ethanol Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CAT-1. The investigated AFAs included (i) commercially available AFAs frequently cited in the fermentation literature, (ii) industrially used AFAs aquired from Brazilian ethanol plants (iii) and a novel AFA named Novozym{\textregistered} 50207. AFA treatments were investigated in defined laboratory batch cultivations and in laboratory simulation of the Brazilian ethanol production process. It was shown that in concentrations relevant for defoaming, industrially used AFAs reduced mmax and ethanol productivity while commercial AFAs showed no effect on cell physiology in terms of yields or productivity. When introduced to the industrial process, industrial defoaming treatments reduced cell viability compared to the control, and the effects where increasing with increasing AFA concentration and exposure time. Treatments with Novozym{\textregistered} 50207, on the other hand did not affect the yeast physiology as compared to the control. Transcriptome analysis showed that all AFA treatments induced additional stress responses in the yeast compared to the control, shown by an up-regulation of stress specific genes and/or a down-regulation of growth related processes. This study documents for the first time the detrimental effects associated with industrially used chemical defoaming treatments, and show the potential of developing novel systems for foam control to improve the production performance of industrial fermentation processes.},

abstract = {Operation at low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations ({\textless}1 mg/L) in wastewater treatment could save utilities significantly by reducing aeration energy costs. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of low DO on pharmaceutical biotransformations during treatment. DO concentration can impact pharmaceutical biotransformation rates during wastewater treatment both directly and indirectly: directly by acting as a limiting substrate that slows the activity of the microorganisms involved in biotransformation; and indirectly by shaping the microbial community and selecting for a community that performs pharmaceutical biotransformation faster (or slower). In this study, nitrifying bioreactors were operated at low (∼0.3 mg/L) and high ({\textgreater}4 mg/L) DO concentrations to understand how DO growth conditions impacted microbial community structure. Short-term batch experiments using the biomass from the parent reactors were performed under low and high DO conditions to understand how DO concentration impacts microbial physiology. Although the low DO parent biomass had a lower specific activity with respect to ammonia oxidation than the high DO parent reactor biomass, it had faster biotransformation rates of ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, 17$\alpha$-ethinylestradiol, acetaminophen, and atenolol in high DO batch conditions. This was likely because the low DO reactor had a 2x higher biomass concentration, was enriched for ammonia oxidizers (4x higher concentration), and harbored a more diverse microbial community (3x more unique taxa) as compared to the high DO parent reactor. Overall, the results show that there can be indirect benefits from low DO operation over high DO operation that support pharmaceutical biotransformation during wastewater treatment.},

abstract = {During infection, vertebrates limit access to manganese and zinc, starving invading pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, of these essential metals in a process termed "nutritional immunity." The manganese and zinc binding protein calprotectin is a key component of the nutrient-withholding response, and mice lacking this protein do not sequester manganese from S. aureus liver abscesses. One potential mechanism utilized by S. aureus to minimize host-imposed manganese and zinc starvation is the expression of the metal transporters MntABC and MntH. We performed transcriptional analyses of both mntA and mntH, which revealed increased expression of both systems in response to calprotectin treatment. MntABC and MntH compete with calprotectin for manganese, which enables S. aureus growth and retention of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase activity. Loss of MntABC and MntH results in reduced staphylococcal burdens in the livers of wild-type but not calprotectin-deficient mice, suggesting that these systems promote manganese acquisition during infection. During the course of these studies, we observed that metal content and the importance of calprotectin varies between murine organs, and infection leads to profound changes in the anatomical distribution of manganese and zinc. In total, these studies provide insight into the mechanisms utilized by bacteria to evade host-imposed nutrient metal starvation and the critical importance of restricting manganese availability during infection.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the impact of high oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, Escherichia coli was grown in batch cultivations where the air supply was enriched with either oxygen or carbon dioxide. The effect of elevated concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide on stochiometric and kinetic constants was studied this way. The maximum growth rate was significantly reduced, the production of acetic acid and the biomass yield coefficient on glucose increased in cultures with carbon dioxide enriched air, compared to reference cultivations and cultivations with oxygen enriched air. The application of oxygen enriched air was studied in high cell density cultivations of Escherichia coli. Two production processes were chosen to investigate the impact of oxygen enrichment. Biomass concentration, specific growth rate, yield coefficient, respiration, mixed acid fermentation products and the product yield and quality for the recombinant product were investigated. First, a process for the production of biomass was investigated. Exponential growth could proceed for a longer time and higher growth rates could be maintained with oxygen enriched air supply. However, a higher specific oxygen consumption rate per glucose was measured after the start of the oxygen enrichment, indicating higher maintenance and consequently the growth rate and yield coefficient decreased drastically in the end of the process. Second, a process for the production of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) was investigated. Although the glucose feed rate and all medium components were doubled, the amount of produced biomass could only be increased by 77{\%} when oxygen enriched air (40{\%} oxygen) supply was applied. This was due to a decreased yield coefficient of biomass per glucose. The total amount of produced product was decreased by almost 50{\%} compared to the control, although less proteolytically degraded variants were produced. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {A fundamental obstacle in systemic therapy for cancer patients is the specific targeting of therapy directly to solid tumors. A strain of the domestic bacterium Bifidobacterium longum, which is non-pathogenic and anaerobic, showed selective localization to and proliferation within solid tumors after systemic application. Here, we propose a novel approach to cancer gene therapy in which anaerobic and non-pathogenic bacteria of the genus B. longum are used to achieve tumor-specific gene delivery and enzyme-prodrug therapy. We constructed a plasmid, pBLES100-S-eCD, which included eCD. Transfected B. longum produced CD in hypoxic tumors and achieved tumor site-specific conversion of 5-FC to 5-FU. Furthermore, we demonstrated antitumor efficacy in rat bearing autochthonous mammary tumors injected with the transfected B. longum directly or intravenously. This method was confirmed to be effective for enzyme-prodrug therapy not only by intratumoral injection but also by systemic administration. To estimate the toxicity of this bacterial vector, the systemic immunogenicity was evaluated by ASA reaction and the anaphylactic activity of IgG was evaluated by PCA reaction in guinea pigs. In the ASA reaction, no anaphylaxis symptoms were observed in any immunized guinea pigs injected with transfected B. longum. In the PCA reaction, B. longum/S-eCD specific-PCA-induced antibody was not detected. Thus, we proposed that anaerobic bacteria of the genus B. longum were an attractive and safe tumor-targeting vector and transfected B. longum was a potential anticancer agent that could effectively and specifically treat solid tumors.},

abstract = {The addition of penicillin G to combat microbial contamination in continuous fuel alcohol fermentations was performed using both continuous and pulsed addition regimes. In continuous fermentations where both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus paracasei were present, the mode of addition of penicillin G determined final numbers of viable L. paracasei. When the same overall average concentration of penicillin G was added in both pulsed and continuous modes, the initial viable number of L. paracasei (8.0 x 10(9) cfu ml(-1)) decreased to a greater degree (1.02 x 10(5) cfu ml(-1) L. paracasei) when penicillin G was pulsed at 6 h frequencies at an overall average concentration of 2,475 U/l than when penicillin G was added continuously at 2,475 U/l (2.77 x 10(5) cfu ml(-1) L. paracasei). Pulsed additions over longer frequencies at 2,475 U/l were not as effective in reducing viable bacteria. Viable yeasts increased during both treatment conditions by more than 2-fold. The two addition regimes also eliminated the 40{\%} decrease in ethanol concentration caused by the intentional bacterial infection. Although there was 3 times more bacterial death with 6 h pulsed additions compared to continuous additions of penicillin G at 2,475 U/l, there was, by that point, no practical difference in either final ethanol concentration or relative ethanol recovery.},

abstract = {DNA extraction and primer choice have a large effect on the observed community structure in all microbial amplicon sequencing analyses. Although the biases are well known, no comprehensive analysis has been conducted in activated sludge communities. In this study we systematically explored the impact of a number of parameters on the observed microbial community: bead beating intensity, primer choice, extracellular DNA removal, and various PCR settings. In total, 176 samples were subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and selected samples were investigated through metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization was used as a DNA extraction-independent method for qualitative comparison. In general, an effect on the observed community was found on all parameters tested, although bead beating and primer choice had the largest effect. The effect of bead beating intensity correlated with cell-wall strength as seen by a large increase in DNA from Gram-positive bacteria (up to 400{\%}). However, significant differences were present at lower phylogenetic levels within the same phylum, suggesting that additional factors are at play. The best primer set based on in silico analysis was found to underestimate a number of important bacterial groups. For 16S rRNA gene analysis in activated sludge we recommend using the FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil with four times the normal bead beating and V1-3 primers.},

abstract = {Isogeometric topological shape optimization method for structural problem is developed using level set method. The isogeometric method is an emerging method that has numerous advantages over the classical finite element method due to its convenience of basis functions generated from NURBS. Therefore, a geometric model is easily converted to an isogeometric analysis model without loss of higher order geometric information such as normal vector and curvature. Nevertheless, the isogeometric method needs a lot of geometric information for complex geometric model and has a difficulty in representing a topological shape variation due to the nature of tensor product of NURBS. To overcome these difficulties, in the isogeometric framework, we employ a level set method where the initial domain is kept and its boundary is represented by an implicit moving boundary embedded in the level set function that facilitates to handle complicated topological shape variation and eventually leads the initial implicit boundary to an optimal topology. For representing voids in a domain where the level set function is defined, Heaviside enrichment function is utilized, which leads to continuous stress fields as well as discontinuous displacements fields even in a single patch. Since the implicit moving boundary is used, it is easy to represent the topological shape variations, where the overall shape is controlled by outer control points. REFERENCES},

abstract = {Evolving cellular communities, such as the gut microbiome, pathogenic infections, and cancer, consist of large populations of {\~{}}107-1014 cells. Because of their large population sizes, adaptation within these populations can be driven by many beneficial mutations that never rise above extremely low frequencies. Genome sequencing methods such as clonal, single cell, or whole population sequencing are poorly suited to detect these rare beneficial lineages, and, more generally, to characterize which mutations are most important to the population dynamics. Here, we introduce an alternative approach: high-resolution lineage tracking with DNA barcodes. In contrast to whole genome sequencing, lineage tracking can detect a beneficial mutation at an extremely low frequency within the population, and estimate its time of occurrence and fitness effect. Many lineage trajectories can be observed in parallel, allowing one to observe the population dynamics in exquisite detail. We describe some of the technical and analytical challenges to lineage tracking with DNA barcodes and discuss its applications to studies of evolution, infectious disease and cancer.},

Total ethanol production costs of first generation processing may decrease from 700US{\$}2010/m3 in 2010, to 432US{\$}2010/m3 in 2030. First generation ethanol production costs may decrease by reduced feedstock costs, increase in sugar content, utilization of cane trash, and use of sweet sorghum. Furthermore, the improvement in industrial efficiency of the first generation process, increasing industrial scale and change to an improved technology are other measures. For second generation technology utilizing eucalyptus, the total ethanol production costs could be strongly reduced to 424US{\$}2010/m3 in 2030. Costs reduction measures for second generation industrial processing include reduced feedstock costs, increasing industrial efficiency and scale, and a change to more advanced industrial process. Overall, biomass yield, increase in sugar content of sugarcane, and improved industrial efficiency are important parameters in total ethanol production costs. Ongoing RD{\&}D effort and commercialization of second generation industrial processing may result in the lowest ethanol production costs for second generation processing in the future.},

abstract = {Yeasts are the main driving force behind several industrial food fermentation processes, including the production of beer,wine, sake, bread, and chocolate. Historically, these processes developed from uncontrolled, spontaneous fer- mentation reactions that rely on a complex mixture of microbes present in the environment. Because such spontaneous processes are generally incon- sistent and inefficient and often lead to the formation of off-flavors,most of today's industrial production utilizes defined starter cultures, often consist- ing of a specific domesticated strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. bayanus,or S. pastorianus. Although this practice greatly improved process consistency, efficiency, and overall quality, it also limited the sensorial complexity of the end product. In this review, we discuss how Saccharomyces yeasts were do- mesticated to become the main workhorse of food fermentations, and we investigate the potential and selection of nonconventional yeasts that are often found in spontaneous fermentations, such as Brettanomyces, Hansenias- pora,and Pichia spp.},

abstract = {Bacterial diversity in contaminated fuels has not been systematically investigated using cultivation-independent methods. The fuel industry relies on phenotypic cultivation-based contaminant identification, which may lack accuracy and neglect difficult-to-culture taxa. By the use of industry practice aerobic cultivation, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and strain genotyping, a collection of 152 unique contaminant isolates from 54 fuel samples was assembled, and a dominance of Pseudomonas (21{\%}), Burkholderia (7{\%}), and Bacillus (7{\%}) was demonstrated. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 15 samples revealed Proteobacteria and Firmicutes to be the most abundant phyla. When 16S rRNA V6 gene pyrosequencing of four selected fuel samples (indicated by "JW") was performed, Betaproteobacteria (42.8{\%}) and Gammaproteobacteria (30.6{\%}) formed the largest proportion of reads; the most abundant genera were Marinobacter (15.4{\%}; JW57), Achromobacter (41.6{\%}; JW63), Burkholderia (80.7{\%}; JW76), and Halomonas (66.2{\%}; JW78), all of which were also observed by DGGE. However, the Clostridia (38.5{\%}) and Deltaproteobacteria (11.1{\%}) identified by pyrosequencing in sample JW57 were not observed by DGGE or aerobic culture. Genotyping revealed three instances where identical strains were found: (i) a Pseudomonas sp. strain recovered from 2 different diesel fuel tanks at a single industrial site; (ii) a Mangroveibacter sp. strain isolated from 3 biodiesel tanks at a single refinery site; and (iii) a Burkholderia vietnamiensis strain present in two unrelated automotive diesel samples. Overall, aerobic cultivation of fuel contaminants recovered isolates broadly representative of the phyla and classes present but lacked accuracy by overrepresenting members of certain groups such as Pseudomonas.},

abstract = {Microbial contamination is a pervasive problem in any ethanol fermentation system. These infections can at minimum affect the efficiency of the fermentation and at their worse lead to stuck fermentations causing plants to shut down for cleaning before beginning anew. These delays can result in costly loss of time as well as lead to an increased cost of the final product. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are the most common bacterial contaminants found in ethanol production facilities and have been linked to decreased ethanol production during fermentation. Lactobacillus sp. generally predominant as these bacteria are well adapted for survival under high ethanol, low pH and low oxygen conditions found during fermentation. It has been generally accepted that lactobacilli cause inhibition of Saccharomyces sp. and limit ethanol production through two basic methods; either production of lactic and acetic acids or through competition for nutrients. However, a number of researchers have demonstrated that these mechanisms may not completely account for the amount of loss observed and have suggested other means by which bacteria can inhibit yeast growth and ethanol production. While LAB are the primary contaminates of concern in industrial ethanol fermentations, wild yeast may also affect the productivity of these fermentations. Though many yeast species have the ability to thrive in a fermentation environment, Dekkera bruxellensis has been repeatedly targeted and cited as one of the main contaminant yeasts in ethanol production. Though widely studied for its detrimental effects on wine, the specific species–species interactions between D. bruxellensis and S. cerevisiae are still poorly understood.},

abstract = {Heating, cooling and lighting appliances in buildings account for more than one third of the world's primary energy demand and there are great potentials, which can be obtained through better applications of the energy use in buildings. In this regard, the building sector has a high potential for improving the quality match between energy supply and demand because high temperature sources are used to meet low-temperature heating needs. Low exergy (or LowEx) systems are defined as heating or cooling systems that allow the use of low valued energy, which is delivered by sustainable energy sources (i.e., through heat pumps, solar collectors, either separate or linked to waste heat, energy storage) as the energy source. These systems practically provide heating and cooling energy at a temperature close to room temperature while the so-called LowEx approach, which has been and still being successfully used in sustainable buildings design. The present study comprehensively reviews the studies conducted on LowEx heating and cooling systems for establishing the sustainable buildings. In this context, an introductory information is given first. Next, energy utilization and demand in buildings are summarized while various exergy definitions and sustainability aspects along with dead (reference) state are described. LowEx heating and cooling systems are then introduced. After that, LowEx relations used to estimate energy and exergy demand in buildings and key parameters for performance assessment and comparison purposes are presented. Finally, LowEx studies and applications conducted are reviewed while the last section concludes. The exergy efficiency values of the LowEx heating and cooling systems for buildings are obtained to range from 0.40{\%} to 25.3{\%} while those for greenhouses vary between 0.11{\%} and 11.5{\%}. The majority of analyses and assessments of LowEx systems are based on heating of buildings. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are good candidates for the development of oral vectors, and are attractive alternatives to attenuated pathogens, for mucosal delivery strategies. In this review, we summarize recent results on the use of LAB as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins and DNA vaccines. Most of this work has been based on the model LAB, Lactococcus lactis, which is suitable for the heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins. Recombinant lactococci and lactobacilli strains expressing antiproteases and antioxidant enzymes have been tested successfully for their prophylactic and therapeutic effects in murine models of colitis. Recombinant lactococci secreting autoantigens have been found to be effective for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Also, recombinant lactococci delivering DNA were able to prevent a bovine $\beta$-lactoglobulin (BLG)-allergic reaction in mice. We believe that these various coherent findings demonstrate the potential value of using LAB, particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains, to develop novel vectors for the therapeutic delivery of proteins to mucosal surfaces. Further tests and in particular human clinical trials are now important next steps to conclude on the benefit of these approaches for human health. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using anaerobic microbial consortia perturbed with the controlled addition of various carbon sources, it is possible to quantitatively discriminate between divergent microbiome analogous to community fingerprinting techniques using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). The utility of flow cytometry based method has also been demonstrated in a fully functional industry scale anaerobic digester to distinguish between microbiome composition caused by varying hydraulic retention time (HRT).

abstract = {Management of phosphorus discharge from human waste is essential for the control of eutrophication in surface waters. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is a sustainable, efficient way of removing phosphorus from waste water without employing chemical precipitation, but is assumed unachievable in tropical temperatures due to conditions that favour glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) over polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). Here, we show these assumptions are unfounded by studying comparative community dynamics in a full-scale plant following systematic perturbation of operational conditions, which modified community abundance, function and physicochemical state. A statistically significant increase in the relative abundance of the PAO Accumulibacter was associated with improved EBPR activity. GAO relative abundance also increased, challenging the assumption of competition. An Accumulibacter bin-genome was identified from a whole community metagenomic survey, and comparative analysis against extant Accumulibacter genomes suggests a close relationship to Type II. Analysis of the associated metatranscriptome data revealed that genes encoding proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis pathways were highly expressed, consistent with metabolic modelling results. Our findings show that tropical EBPR is indeed possible, highlight the translational potential of studying competition dynamics in full-scale waste water communities and carry implications for plant design in tropical regions.

The ProAlcool started as a highly innovative programme, but in recent years has lost part of its technological zeal and in certain areas is becoming stagnant. This is due to a combination of reasons, e.g. unclear energy policy, high sugar prices in the international market and lower investment in ethanol production as a result of low international oil prices. A new impetus is needed to reflect changing economic and energy policy in Brazil. This paper reviews the implications for ProAlcool of the new economic policies and the possibilities for restructuring the programme to guarantee its survival as a pioneering and sustainable renewable energy source.

abstract = {AIMS: We asked to what extent does the application of the OSMAC (one strain, many compounds) approach lead to enhanced detection of antibiotics and secondary metabolites in fungi? Protocols for bacterial microfermentations were adapted to grow fungi in nutritional arrays. METHODS AND RESULTS: Protocols for microfermentations of non-sporulating fungi were validated using known antifungal-producing fungi. Detection of antifungal activity was often medium dependent. The effects of medium arrays and numbers of strains on detection of antifungal signals were modelled by interpolation of rarefaction curves derived from matrices of positive and negative extracts. Increasing the number of fermentation media for any given strain increased the probability of detection of growth inhibition of Candida albicans. Increasing biodiversity increased detection of antifungal phenotypes, however, nutritional arrays could partly compensate for lost antibiotic phenotypes when biodiversity was limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Growth and extraction in microtiter plates can enable a discovery strategy emphasizing low-cost medium arrays that can better exploit the metabolic potential of strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Increasing fermentation parameters raise the probability of detecting bioactive metabolites from strains. The protocols can be used to pre-select strains and their growth conditions for scale up that will most likely yield antibiotics and secondary metabolites.},

abstract = {Determining the effect of gene deletion is a fundamental approach to understanding gene function. Conventional genetic screens exhibit biases, and genes contributing to a phenotype are often missed. We systematically constructed a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants (96{\%} of annotated open reading frames, or ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequences dubbed 'molecular bar codes' uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7{\%} of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions. Our results validate the yeast gene-deletion collection as a valuable resource for functional genomics.},

abstract = {In contrast to the complex acoustic environments we encounter everyday, most studies of auditory segregation have used relatively simple signals. Here, we synthesized a new stimulus to examine the detection of coherent patterns ('figures') from overlapping 'background' signals. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that human listeners are remarkably sensitive to the emergence of such figures and can tolerate a variety of spectral and temporal perturbations. This robust behavior is consistent with the existence of automatic auditory segregation mechanisms that are highly sensitive to correlations across frequency and time. The observed behavior cannot be explained purely on the basis of adaptation-based models used to explain the segregation of deterministic narrowband signals. We show that the present results are consistent with the predictions of a model of auditory perceptual organization based on temporal coherence. Our data thus support a role for temporal coherence as an organizational principle underlying auditory segregation. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00699.001.},

abstract = {The rate of production of methane in many environments depends upon mutualistic interactions between sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens. To enhance our understanding of these relationships, we took advantage of the fully sequenced genomes of Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Methanococcus maripaludis to produce and analyze the first multispecies stoichiometric metabolic model. Model results were compared to data on growth of the co-culture on lactate in the absence of sulfate. The model accurately predicted several ecologically relevant characteristics, including the flux of metabolites and the ratio of D. vulgaris to M. maripaludis cells during growth. In addition, the model and our data suggested that it was possible to eliminate formate as an interspecies electron shuttle, but hydrogen transfer was essential for syntrophic growth. Our work demonstrated that reconstructed metabolic networks and stoichiometric models can serve not only to predict metabolic fluxes and growth phenotypes of single organisms, but also to capture growth parameters and community composition of simple bacterial communities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Bacteria may compete with yeast for nutrients during bioethanol production process, potentially causing economic losses. This is the first study aiming at the quantification and identification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) present in the bioethanol industrial processes in different distilleries of Brazil. RESULTS A total of 489 LAB isolates were obtained from four distilleries in 2007 and 2008. The abundance of LAB in the fermentation tanks varied between 6.0 × 105 and 8.9 × 108 CFUs/mL. Crude sugar cane juice contained 7.4 × 107 to 6.0 × 108 LAB CFUs. Most of the LAB isolates belonged to the genus Lactobacillus according to rRNA operon enzyme restriction profiles. A variety of Lactobacillus species occurred throughout the bioethanol process, but the most frequently found species towards the end of the harvest season were L. fermentum and L. vini. The different rep-PCR patterns indicate the co-occurrence of distinct populations of the species L. fermentum and L. vini, suggesting a great intraspecific diversity. Representative isolates of both species had the ability to grow in medium containing up to 10{\%} ethanol, suggesting selection of ethanol tolerant bacteria throughout the process. CONCLUSIONS This study served as a first survey of the LAB diversity in the bioethanol process in Brazil. The abundance and diversity of LAB suggest that they have a significant impact in the bioethanol process.},

abstract = {Background: The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results: Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions: The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology is founded on the idea that cells are living machines that execute genetically encoded programs, and that we as engineers can reprogram them to perform new functions. Unlike man-made machines that are designed from the ground up, cells have been shaped and molded by evolution, and this makes them much more difficult to engineer. As synthetic biology has grown and matured, the field has shifted from focusing primarily on simpler bacterial chassis to engineering more complex and more powerful eukaryotic hosts, especially the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present technologies and strategies for efficiently engineering yeast, with an emphasis on metabolic engineering. First, we describe a practical framework for designing and constructing DNA for expression in yeast. This framework standardizes—and as a consequence, accelerates—the process of building new strains, enabling more rapid itera- tion and experimentation. We then develop a strategy for optimizing metabolic pathways by assembling combinatorial libraries that simultaneously titrate the expression of many genes. We identify strains with improved pathway flux for violacein biosynthesis and xylose utilization using mathematical modeling and selection, respectively. Finally, we attempt to alter the specificity of a native hexose transporter to exclusively import xylose without inhibition by glucose. In summary, this work is a combination of developing fundamental tools for engineering yeast and the application of those tools for lignocellulosic biomass fermentation.},

abstract = {Many factors contribute to a successful natural fermentation of carbohydrate-rich food and feed products. Metabolic activities of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play a leading role. Their ability to rapidly produce copious amounts of acidic end products with a concomitant pH reduction is the major factor in these fermentations. Although their specific effects are difficult to quantitate, other LAB metabolic products such as hydrogen peroxide and diacetyl can also contribute to the overall antibiosis and preservative potential of these products. The contribution of bacteriocins is also difficult to evaluate. It is suggested that they may play a role in selecting the microflora which initiates the fermentation. Bacteriocins are believed to be important in the ability of LAB to compete in non-fermentative ecosystems such as the gastro-intestinal tract. During the past few decades interest has arisen in the use of the varied antagonistic activities of LAB to extent the shelf-life of protein-rich products such as meats and fish. Recent findings indicate that the newly discovered Lactobacillus reuteri reuterin system may be used for this purpose.},

abstract = {Our previous studies identified two iron-regulated cytoplasmic membrane proteins of 32 and 36 kDa ex-pressed by both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. In this study we show by Triton X-114 phase partitioning and tritiated palmitic acid labelling that these proteins are lipoproteins which are anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane by their lipid-modified N termini. In common with those of some other gram-positive bacteria, these highly immunogenic lipoproteins were released from the bacterial cell into the culture supernatants, with release being promoted by growth of the bacteria under iron-restricted conditions. Immu-noelectron microscopy with a monospecific rabbit antiserum to the 32-kDa S. epidermidis lipoprotein showed that the majority of the antigen was distributed throughout the staphylococcal cell wall. Only minor quantities were detected in the cytoplasmic membrane, and exposure of the lipoprotein on the bacterial surface was min-imal. A monoclonal antibody raised to the 32-kDa lipoprotein of S. aureus was used in immunoblotting studies to investigate the conservation of this antigen among a variety of staphylococci. The monoclonal antibody reacted with polypeptides of 32 kDa in S. epidermidis and S. aureus and of 40 kDa in Staphylococcus hominis. No reactivity was detected with Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus cohni, or Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The gene encoding the 32-kDa lipoprotein from S. epidermidis has been isolated from a Lambda Zap II genomic DNA library and found to be a component of an iron-regulated operon encoding a novel ABC-type transporter. The operon contains three genes, designated sitA, -B, and -C, encoding an ATPase, a cytoplasmic membrane pro-tein, and the 32-kDa lipoprotein, respectively. SitC shows significant homology both with a number of bacterial adhesins, including FimA of Streptococcus parasanguis and ScaA of Streptococcus gordonii, and with lipoproteins of a recently described family of ABC transporters with proven or putative metal ion transport functions. Although the solute specificity of this novel transporter has not yet been determined, we speculate that it may be involved in either siderophore-or transferrin-mediated iron uptake in S. epidermidis. Staphylococci respond to iron deprivation in vitro and in vivo by increasing the expression of a number of iron-regulated proteins (24, 28, 36, 41). These include a 42-kDa cell wall-associated transferrin binding protein and two cytoplasmic membrane proteins of 32 and 36 kDa whose functions are at present unknown (28, 36). The association of the latter pro-teins with the cytoplasmic membrane is based on cell fraction-ation data, but the mechanism of anchorage of these proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane is also currently unclear. In other bacteria, some cytoplasmic membrane proteins are integral to the membrane and are held in place by hydrophobic mem-brane-spanning regions or hydrophobic N-or C-terminal an-chors (31). Other membrane-associated proteins have been shown to be lipoproteins, and these are tethered to the outer surface of the membrane by their lipid-modified N termini (17, 38). Functionally, both groups of proteins may be components of ATP binding cassette (ABC)-type transporters involved in solute acquisition (13, 39). These multicomponent transporters have common structural and organizational features, and func-tions in addition to solute transport have recently been attrib-uted to some ABC transporter lipoproteins. Studies with gram-positive bacteria show that the lipoproteins SarA and SsaB mediate adherence of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguis, respectively, to salivary pellicle components (15, 22, 29). FimA from Streptococcus parasanguis is involved in attach-ment of the bacterium to fibrin clots in a rat endocarditis mod-el and to platelet fibrin matrix clots in vitro (14, 40). These functional studies and other antibody binding studies support the surface location of these streptococcal lipoproteins (20, 21, 40). The Enterococcus faecalis lipoprotein EfaA also shows se-quence homology with streptococcal adhesins, including FimA, SsaB, and ScaA, indicating that EfaA may also be a surface-exposed adhesin (25). In contrast to the case for other gram-positive organisms, ABC transporters in the staphylococci have been little studied. Proteins that may function as components of an ABC trans-porter involved in erythromycin resistance have been detected in Staphylococcus epidermidis (32), but this system has not been fully characterized and no homologies with such systems in other bacteria have yet been reported. ABC exporters are implicated in the secretion of the lantibiotics epidermin (13) and Pep5 (26) by S. epidermidis and of gallidermin (13) by Staphylococcus gallidermidis. DNA sequence analysis has also identified an ABC transporter of unknown function in},

abstract = {Bioethanol (fuel alcohol) has been produced by industrial alcoholic fermentation processes in Brazil since the beginning of the twentieth century. Currently, 432 mills and distilleries crush about 625 million tons of sugarcane per crop, producing about 27 billion liters of ethanol and 38.7 million tons of sugar. The production of bioethanol from sugarcane represents a major large-scale technology capable of producing biofuel efficiently and economically, providing viable substitutes to gasoline. The combination of immobilization of CO₂ by sugarcane crops by photosynthesis into biomass together with alcoholic fermentation of this biomass has allowed production of a clean and high-quality liquid fuel that contains 93{\%} of the original energy found in sugar. Over the last 30 years, several innovations have been introduced to Brazilian alcohol distilleries resulting in the improvement of plant efficiency and economic competitiveness. Currently, the main scientific challenges are to develop new technologies for bioethanol production from first and second generation feedstocks that exhibit positive energy balances and appropriately meet environmental sustainability criteria. This review focuses on these aspects and provides special emphasis on the selection of new yeast strains, genetic breeding, and recombinant DNA technology, as applied to bioethanol production processes.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used in the biotechnology industry for production of ethanol, recombinant proteins, food ingredients and other chemicals. In order to generate highly producing and stable strains, genome integration of genes encoding metabolic pathway enzymes is the preferred option. However, integration of pathway genes in single or few copies, especially those encoding rate-controlling steps, is often not sufficient to sustain high metabolic fluxes. By exploiting the sequence diversity in the long terminal repeats (LTR) of Ty retrotransposons, we developed a new set of integrative vectors, EasyCloneMulti, that enables multiple and simultaneous integration of genes in S. cerevisiae. By creating vector backbones that combine consensus sequences that aim at targeting subsets of Ty sequences and a quickly degrading selective marker, integrations at multiple genomic loci and a range of expression levels were obtained, as assessed with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter system. The EasyCloneMulti vector set was applied to balance the expression of the rate-controlling step in the $\beta$-alanine pathway for biosynthesis of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP). The best 3HP producing clone, with 5.45 g.L-1 of 3HP, produced 11 times more 3HP than the lowest producing clone, which demonstrates the capability of EasyCloneMulti vectors to impact metabolic pathway enzyme activity.},

METHODS: By searching through the most current literature and engaging in discussions with industry experts, it is possible to identify avenues that could increase services to those who have hearing loss with innovative healthcare technology. This article aims to review the current state as well as future trends of hearing health technology by addressing: Technology as We Know it; and Technology as We Dream it. RESULTS: Some of the newer technologies we have recently witnessed include: micro processors; personalized computing devices (e.g. smartphones); web-based applications; an expanding clinical repertoire with integrated test equipment; and globalization of telecommunications that opens the door to telehealth; and self-fitting of hearing aids. Yet, innovation continues scaffolding on recent successes with innovations for hearing healthcare expected to increase into the future. CONCLUSION: As technology and connectivity continue to evolve so should the practice of audiology adapt to the global needs by capitalizing on these advances to optimize service delivery access and sustainability. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Capital investment in equipment will be dramatically reduced with smaller, lighter, less costly and more portable equipment. Individuals who live in remote regions with little or no hearing healthcare access can undergo valid assessments by a professional via telehealth. Web-based applications allow clinicians to expand their repertoire and reach of services.},

abstract = {To gain a better understanding of contaminating bacteria in bioethanol industry, we profiled the bacterial community structure in corn-based bioethanol fermentations and evaluated its correlation to environmental variables. Twenty-three batches of corn-mash sample were collected from six bioethanol facilities. The V4 region of the collective bacterial 16S rRNA genes was analyzed by Illumina Miseq sequencing to investigate the bacterial community structure. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination plots were constructed to visualize bacterial community structure groupings among different samples, as well as the effects of multiple environmental variables on community structure variation. Our results suggest that bacterial community structure is facility-specific, although there are two core bacterial phyla, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Feedstock, facility, and fermentation technology may explain the difference in community structure between different facilities. Lactic acid, the most important environmental variable that influences bacterial community structure grouping, could be utilized as an indicator of bacterial contamination. We also identified genes responsible for the multiple antibiotic-resistance phenotype of an Enterobacter cloacae strain isolated from a bioethanol fermentation facility. We performed PCR assays and revealed the presence of canonical genes encoding resistance to penicillin and erythromycin. However, a gene encoding resistance to virginiamycin was not detected},

abstract = {Diversity measurement is important for understanding community structure and dynamics, but has been particularly challenging for microorganisms. Microbial community characterization using small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences has revealed an extensive, previously unsuspected diversity that we are only now beginning to understand, especially now that advanced sequencing technologies are producing datasets containing hundreds of thousands of sequences from hundreds of samples. Efforts to quantify microbial diversity often use taxon-based methods that ignore the fact that not all species are equally related, which can therefore obscure important patterns in the data. For example, alpha-diversity (diversity within communities) is often estimated as the number of species in a community (species richness), and beta-diversity (partitioning of diversity among communities) is often based on the number of shared species. Methods for measuring alpha- and beta-diversity that account for different levels of divergence between individuals have recently been more widely applied. These methods are more powerful than taxon-based methods because microorganisms in a community differ dramatically in sequence similarity, which also often correlates with phenotypic similarity in key features such as metabolic capabilities. Consequently, divergence-based methods are providing new insights into microbial community structure and function.},

Consequently, there have been extensive efforts to characterize its cellular processes. In order to fully understand the relationship between yeast's genome and its physiology, the stockpiles of diverse biological data sets that describe its cellular components and phenotypic behavior must be integrated at the genome-scale. Genome-scale metabolic networks have been reconstructed for several microorganisms, including S. cerevisiae, and the properties of these networks have been successfully analyzed using a variety of constraint-based methods. Phenotypic phase plane analysis is a constraint-based method which provides a global view of how optimal growth rates are affected by changes in two environmental variables such as a carbon and an oxygen uptake rate. Some applications of phenotypic phase plane analysis include the study of optimal growth rates and of network capacity and function.},

abstract = {Batch and continuous cultures of a newly isolated Clostridium butyricum strain were carried out on industrial glycerol, the major by-product of the bio-diesel production process. For both types of cultures, the conversion yield obtained was around 0.55 g of 1,3-propanediol formed per 1 g of glycerol consumed whereas the highest 1,3-propanediol concentration, achieved during the single-stage continuous cultures was 35-48 g l-1. Moreover, the strain presented a strong tolerance at the inhibitory effect of the 1,3-propanediol, even at high concentrations of this substance at the chemostat (e.g. 80 g l-1). 1,3-Propanediol was associated with cell growth whereas acetate and butyrate seemed non growth-associated products. At low and medium dilution rates (until 0.1 h-1), butyrate production was favoured, whereas at higher rates acetate production increased. The maximum 1,3-propanediol volumetric productivity obtained was 5.5 g l-1 h-1. A two-stage continuous fermentation was also carried out. The first stage presented high 1,3-propanediol volumetric productivity, whereas the second stage (with a lower dilution rate) served to further increase the final product concentration. High 1,3-propanediol concentrations were achieved (41-46 g l-1), with a maximum volumetric productivity of 3.4 g l-1 h-1. A cell concentration decrease was reported between the second and the first fermentor.},

The main byproduct of glucose metabolism was acetate, the production of which was strongly dependent upon the ratio of the carbon to salt concentration and the growth rate. As an explanation for acetate accumulation a saturation of the respiratory system (including the phosphorylation system) at higher dilution rates is suggested. Based on the minimal medium developed for lab scale production a high concentrated minimal medium has been developed that permits growth up to high cell densities in batch cultivations (16.5 g l-1 biomass). ?? 1985.},

Bacterial contamination led to reduced yields of ethanol, lower yeast crops, reduced carbohydrate utilization, greatly increased acidity due mainly to production of lactic acid, and lower final pH. Contaminated fermentations showed greatly increased foam production. Certain bacterial strains caused premature flocculation of yeast cells. Reduced ethanol yields were not due simply to competition for carbohydrate: other likely mechanisms for the effect are discussed. ?? 1992.},

From this it is shown that the computational model is able to capture the experimental vibro-impact behavior very well when the excitation amplitudes are reasonably high. Further, the presence of chaos through the period doubling route is demonstrated in the experimental studies. By using independent acceleration and velocity measurements, it is demonstrated that smoothing filters suggested in the literature for generating derivatives (acceleration from velocity) does not work very well for vibro-impact problems.},

abstract = {Currently, bioreactors exploiting natural microbial communities, that is, microbiomes, for bioenergy production are almost exclusively operated based on bulk parameters and empirical expert knowledge. The microbiome of these bioreactors often remains a "black box", that is, its composition and function are only analyzed retrospectively (mostly in a case of failure). Here, on-time microbiome analysis can allow a proactive process management. However, today's sophisticated molecular ecology methods appear inaccessible for the routine analysis of reactor microbiomes in bioenergy production. This review analyzes the requirements of methods for routine microbiome diagnostics. Especially the ability of current molecular and cell based methods to derive structure-function-relationships, that is, correlations between the microbial community structure and dynamics and the reactor performance, are emphasized and key-criteria for routine on-site monitoring are defined. Finally, a critical assessment of selected methods for microbiome monitoring is performed focusing on (i) the production of biogas in anaerobic digesters and (ii) the production of the biofuel precursor n-butyrate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Current fuel ethanol research and development deals with process engineering trends for improving biotechnological production of ethanol. In this work, the key role that process design plays during the development of cost-effective technologies is recognized through the analysis of major trends in process synthesis, modeling, simulation and optimization related to ethanol production. Main directions in techno-economical evaluation of fuel ethanol processes are described as well as some prospecting configurations. The most promising alternatives for compensating ethanol production costs by the generation of valuable co-products are analyzed. Opportunities for integration of fuel ethanol production processes and their implications are underlined. Main ways of process intensification through reaction-reaction, reaction-separation and separation-separation processes are analyzed in the case of bioethanol production. Some examples of energy integration during ethanol production are also highlighted. Finally, some concluding considerations on current and future research tendencies in fuel ethanol production regarding process design and integration are presented. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Denitrification is essential to the removal of nitrogen from wastewater during treatment, yet an understanding of the diversity of the active denitrifying bacteria responsible in full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is lacking. In this study stable isotope probing (SIP) was applied in combination with microautoradiography (MAR)-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to identify previously unrecognised active denitrifying phylotypes in a full-scale WWTP with biological N and P removal. Acknowledging that different denitrifiers will have specific carbon sourcepreferences, a fully (13) C-labelled complex substrate was used for SIP incubations, under nitrite reducing conditions, in order to maximise the capture of the potentially metabolically diverse denitrifiers likely present. Members of the Rhodoferax, Dechloromonas,Sulfuritalea, HaliangiumandThermomonas wererepresented in the 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from DNA enriched in(13) C, with FISH probes optimised here for their in situ characterisation. FISH and MAR confirmed that they were all active denitrifiers in the community. The combined approach of SIP and MAR-FISH represents an excellent approach for identifying and characterising un-described diversity of active denitrifiers in full-scale systems.},

abstract = {Development of strains for efficient production of chemicals and pharmaceuticals requires multiple rounds of genetic engineering. In this study, we describe construction and characterization of EasyClone vector set for baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which enables simultaneous expression of multiple genes with an option of recycling selection markers. The vectors combine the advantage of efficient uracil excision reaction-based cloning and Cre-LoxP-mediated marker recycling system. The episomal and integrative vector sets were tested by inserting genes encoding cyan, yellow, and red fluorescent proteins into separate vectors and analyzing for co-expression of proteins by flow cytometry. Cells expressing genes encoding for the three fluorescent proteins from three integrations exhibited a much higher level of simultaneous expression than cells producing fluorescent proteins encoded on episomal plasmids, where correspondingly 95{\%} and 6{\%} of the cells were within a fluorescence interval of Log10 mean ± 15{\%} for all three colors. We demonstrate that selective markers can be simultaneously removed using Cre-mediated recombination and all the integrated heterologous genes remain in the chromosome and show unchanged expression levels. Hence, this system is suitable for metabolic engineering in yeast where multiple rounds of gene introduction and marker recycling can be carried out.},

abstract = {A number of economic and product quality advantages exist in brewing when high-gravity worts of 16 to 18{\%} dissolved solids are fermented. Above this level, production problems such as slow or stuck fermentations and poor yeast viability occur. Ethanol toxicity has been cited as the main cause, as brewers' yeasts are reported to tolerate only 7 to 9{\%} (vol/vol) ethanol. The inhibitory effect of high osmotic pressure has also been implicated. In this report, it is demonstrated that the factor limiting the production of high levels of ethanol by brewing yeasts is actually a nutritional deficiency. When a nitrogen source, ergosterol, and oleic acid are added to worts up to 31{\%} dissolved solids, it is possible to produce beers up to 16.2{\%} (vol/vol) ethanol. Yeast viability remains high, and the yeasts can be repitched at least five times. Supplementation does not increase the fermentative tolerance of the yeasts to ethanol but increases the length and level of new yeast cell mass synthesis over that seen in unsupplemented wort (and therefore the period of more rapid wort attenuation). Glycogen, protein, and sterol levels in yeasts were examined, as was the importance of pitching rate, temperature, and degree of anaerobiosis. The ethanol tolerance of brewers' yeast is suggested to be no different than that of sake or distillers' yeast.},

abstract = {Lactic acid was added to batch very high gravity (VHG) fermentations and to continuous VHG fermentations equilibrated to steady state with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A 53{\%} reduction in colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1) of S. cerevisiae was observed in continuous fermentation at an undissociated lactic acid concentration of 3.44{\%} w/v; and greater than 99.9{\%} reduction was evident at 5.35{\%} w/v lactic acid. The differences in yeast cell number in these fermentations were not due to pH, since batch fermentations over a pH range of 2.5-5.0 did not lead to changes in growth rate. Similar fermentations performed in batch showed that growth inhibition with added lactic acid was nearly identical. This indicates that the apparent high resistance of S. cerevisiae to lactic acid in continuous VHG fermentations is not a function of culture mode. Although the total amount of ethanol decreased from 48.7 g l(-1) to 14.5 g l(-1) when 4.74{\%} w/v undissociated lactic acid was added, the specific ethanol productivity increased ca. 3.2-fold (from 7.42 x 10(-7) g to 24.0 x 10(-7) g ethanol CFU(-1) h(-1)), which indicated that lactic acid stress improved the ethanol production of each surviving cell. In multistage continuous fermentations, lactic acid was not responsible for the 83{\%} (CFU ml(-1)) reduction in viable S. cerevisiae yeasts when Lactobacillus paracasei was introduced to the system at a controlled pH of 6.0. The competition for trace nutrients in those fermentations and not lactic acid produced by L. paracasei likely caused the yeast inhibition.},

abstract = {Tractable microbial communities are needed to bridge the gap between observations of patterns of microbial diversity and mechanisms that can explain these patterns. We developed cheese rinds as model microbial communities by characterizing in situ patterns of diversity and by developing an in vitro system for community reconstruction. Sequencing of 137 different rind communities across 10 countries revealed 24 widely distributed and culturable genera of bacteria and fungi as dominant community members. Reproducible community types formed independent of geographic location of production. Intensive temporal sampling demonstrated that assembly of these communities is highly reproducible. Patterns of community composition and succession observed in situ can be recapitulated in a simple in vitro system. Widespread positive and negative interactions were identified between bacterial and fungal community members. Cheese rind microbial communities represent an experimentally tractable system for defining mechanisms that influence microbial community assembly and function.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop an index that assesses the degree of adherence to existing diet-lifestyle recommendations for preschoolers (Preschoolers Diet-Lifestyle Index (PDL-Index)) and to investigate its association with obesity.

DESIGN: The PDL-Index was constructed using eleven components (i.e. questions regarding the frequency of consumption of selected foods/food groups, time spent on television watching and on moderate-to-vigorous physical activities).

SETTING: Scores from 0 to 4 were assigned to all components of the index. The PDL-Index total score ranged from 0 to 44. Higher values of the PDL-Index indicate greater adherence to dietary and lifestyle recommendations for preschoolers or otherwise greater adherence to healthier dietary-lifestyle patterns.

SUBJECTS: As a validation procedure, a sample of 2287 preschoolers from Greece (GENESIS study) was used.

RESULTS: The participants following healthier diet-lifestyle patterns (third tertile of PDL-Index) were less likely to be obese or overweight/obese compared to those following unhealthy diet-lifestyle patterns (first tertile of PDL-Index). It was observed that a 1/44 unit increase in the score of the PDL-Index was associated with approximately 5 {\%} and 3 {\%} lower odds of being obese and overweight/obese, respectively. Statistically significant results were observed after adjusting for potential confounders.

CONCLUSIONS: The suggested PDL-Index could help public health policy makers in identifying vulnerable population subgroups and developing cost-effective, targeted intervention actions both in family and preschool settings. In addition, health-care professionals can use the PDL-Index to evaluate diet quality, lifestyle and risk for overweight/obesity at an individual level and counsel parents accordingly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies found that, on average, users overreport their daily amount of hearing aid use compared to objective measures such as data logging. However, the reasons for this are unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: This study assessed data-logged and self-reported amount of hearing aid use in a clinical sample of hearing aid users. It identified predictors of data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and hearing aid use overreport.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESEARCH DESIGN: This observational study recruited adult hearing aid users from 22 private dispensers in the Netherlands and in Denmark.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY SAMPLE: The sample consisted of 228 hearing aid users. Typical participants were over the age of 65 and retired, were fitted binaurally, and had financially contributed to the cost of their hearing aids. Participants had on average a mild-to-severe sloping bilateral hearing impairment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants completed a purposefully designed questionnaire regarding hearing aid usage and the International Outcome Inventory-Hearing Aids. Dispensers collected audiometric results and data logging. Multiple linear regression identified predictors of data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and hearing aid use overreport when controlling for covariates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Data logging showed on average 10.5 hr of hearing aid use (n = 184), while participants reported on average 11.8 hr of daily hearing aid use (n = 206). In participants for which both data-logged and self-reported hearing aid use data were available (n = 166), the average absolute overreport of daily hearing aid use was 1.2 (1 hr and 11 min). Relative overreport was expressed as a rate of absolute overreport divided by data-logged hearing aid use. A positive rate denotes hearing aid use overreport: the average overreport rate was .38. Cluster analysis identified two data-logged patterns: "Regular," where hearing aids are typically switched on for between 12 and 20 hr before their user powers them off (57{\%} of the sample), and "On-off," where hearing aids are typically switched on for shorter periods of time before being powered off (43{\%} of the sample). In terms of self-report, 77{\%} of the sample described their hearing aid use to be the same every day, while 23{\%} of the sample described their hearing aid use to be different from day to day. Participants for whom data logging showed an On-off pattern or who reported their hearing aid use to be different from day to day had significantly fewer data-logged and self-reported hours of hearing aid use. Having an On-off data-logging pattern or describing hearing aid use as the same every day was associated with a significantly greater hearing aid use overreport.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Data-logged and self-reported usage patterns significantly predicted data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and overreport when controlling for covariates. The results point to patterns of hearing aid usage as being at least as important a concept as amount of hearing aid use. Dispensers should discuss not only the "how much", but also the "how" of hearing aid usage with their clients.},

We investigated the growth characteristics of L. vini in co-cultivation together with either Saccharomyces cerevisiae or D. bruxellensis. Lower cell numbers of both the yeasts and L. vini as well as a decrease in ethanol and lactate formation in mixed batch cultures compared to pure cultures were noticed. L. vini formed cell aggregates (flocs) in all cultivation media with different shapes in MRS and YPD. Flocs' size and proportion of cells bound to flocs increased with increasing ethanol concentration. In co-culture formation of LAB-yeast cell aggregates consisting of a bacterial core with an outer layer of yeast cells was observed. L. vini-D. bruxellensis flocs had a bigger surface, due to outsticking cells from pseudomycelium. The involvement of mannose residues in the flocculation between L. vini and yeasts was tested. Presence of mannose induced deflocculation in concentration-dependent manner. Less mannose was required for the deflocculation of D. bruxellensis as compared to S. cerevisiae.

Differences in terms of the range of pathogens that each strain inhibits, however, suggested that production of a single antibiotic cyclic peptide, gramicidin S (GS), by the two strains, is not the sole mechanism of inhibition. The availability of four sequenced genomes of Aneurinibacillus prompted us to apply genome mining techniques to identify the bioactive potential of A. migulanus and to provide insights into the secondary metabolite arsenal of the genus Aneurinibacillus. Up to eleven secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters were present in the three Aneurinibacillus species. Biosynthetic gene clusters specifying bacteriocins, microcins, non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, terpenes, phosphonates, lasso peptides and linaridins were identified. Chitinolytic potential and iron metabolism regulation were also investigated. With increasing numbers of biocontrol bacterial genomes being sequenced and mined, the use of approaches similar to those described in this paper will lead to an increase in the numbers of environmentally friendly natural products available to use against plant diseases.},

abstract = {Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis is a common member of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants and capable of metabolizing human milk oligosaccharides (HMO). To investigate the bacterial response to different prebiotics, we analyzed both cell wall associated and whole cell proteins in B. infantis. Proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS followed by comparative proteomics to deduce the protein localization within the cell. Enzymes involved in the metabolism of lactose, glucose, galactooligosaccharides, fructooligosaccharides and HMO were constitutively expressed exhibiting less than two-fold change regardless of the sugar used. In contrast, enzymes in N-Acetylglucosamine and sucrose catabolism were induced by HMO and fructans, respectively. Galactose-metabolizing enzymes phosphoglucomutase, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase and UTP glucose-1-P uridylytransferase were expressed constitutively, while galactokinase and galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, increased their expression three fold when HMO and lactose were used as substrates for cell growth. Cell wall-associated proteomics also revealed ATP-dependent sugar transport systems associated with consumption of different prebiotics. In addition, the expression of 16 glycosyl hydrolases revealed the complete metabolic route for each substrate. Mucin, which possesses O-glycans that are structurally similar to HMO did not induced the expression of transport proteins, hydrolysis or sugar metabolic pathway indicating B. infantis do not utilize these glycoconjugates.},

abstract = {The metal cations K({\^{}}+), Mg({\^{}}2+), Ca({\^{}}2+), and Zn({\^{}}2+) are known to directly influence fermentative metabolism in yeast, and therefore knowledge of their interactions is essential to manipulate their availability in industrial fermentations to optimal levels. Defined media experimental fermentations were designed to mimic high, intermediate, and low levels of K({\^{}}+), Mg({\^{}}2+), and Ca({\^{}}2+) previously reported in sugarcane molasses and Mg({\^{}}2+), Ca({\^{}}2+), and Zn({\^{}}2+) previously reported in malt wort. Subsequent analysis of fermentations revealed that the yeast (distillers strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae) produced higher levels of ethanol in the presence of higher levels of Mg({\^{}}2+) in synthetic molasses and malt wort. Analysis of variance showed that yeast fermentation performance depended on complex interactions among the metal cations studied. For simulated molasses fermentations with fixed levels of Mg({\^{}}2+), ethanol production varied with changing levels of Ca({\^{}}2+) and K({\^{}}+) in a predictable way that was well fitted by the quadratic response surface model. Maximum predicted ethanol yields found from the quadratic response surface model were generally confirmed by authentic molasses fermentations. In simulated malt wort fermentations with fixed levels of Zn({\^{}}2+), ethanol production varied in a predictable way with changing levels of Ca({\^{}}2+) and Mg({\^{}}2+). However, quadratic response surface model predictions of ethanol yield failed to match results obtained from authentic malt wort fermentations, indicating significant effects of extraneous factors in wort. Although the results from defined media experiments suggest that statistical modeling could prove a useful tool in predicting yeast fermentation performance, further analysis is required of the influence of other components in industrial fermentation media, such as brewers' wort.},

However, whereas hundreds to thousands of clones can be easily generated and sequenced over a few days of experiments, analyzing the data is time consuming and constitutes a major bottleneck for experimental researchers in the field. FINDINGS: Here we present the deFUME web server, an easy-to-use web-based interface for processing, annotation and visualization of functional metagenomics sequencing data, tailored to meet the requirements of non-bioinformaticians. The web-server integrates multiple analysis steps into one single workflow: read assembly, open reading frame prediction, and annotation with BLAST, InterPro and GO classifiers. Analysis results are visualized in an online dynamic web-interface. CONCLUSION: The deFUME webserver provides a fast track from raw sequence to a comprehensive visual data overview that facilitates effortless inspection of gene function, clustering and distribution.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The establishment of a balanced intestinal microflora which may protect against infection is desirable for the preterm infant. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a preterm formula milk supplement consisting of oligosaccharides in similar proportions to human milk on the faecal flora and stool characteristics of preterm infants. STUDY DESIGN: To resemble the effect of human milk, an oligosaccharide mixture consisting of 90{\%} galacto-oligosaccharides and 10{\%} fructo-oligosaccharides was used to supplement a standard preterm formula at a concentration of 10 g/l. This supplemented formula was studied in 15 preterm infants, and the results were compared with those found in 15 infants fed a formula supplemented with maltodextrin as placebo. A group fed fortified mother's milk was investigated as a reference group (n = 12). On four days during a 28 day feeding period (1, 7, 14, and 28), the faecal flora was investigated, and stool characteristics, growth, and possible side effects were recorded. RESULTS: During the study period, the number of bifidobacteria in the group fed the oligosaccharide supplemented formula increased to the upper range of bifidobacteria counts in the reference group. The difference between the supplemented and non-supplemented groups was highly significant (p = 0.0008). The stool characteristics were also influenced by the supplement: the stool frequency after 28 days was significantly lower in the control group than in the oligosaccharide supplemented group (p = 0.0079) and the reference group (p {\textless} 0.0001). Over the study period, the stool consistency in the control group became harder, but remained fairly stable in the other two groups. There was no effect of the different diets on the incidence of side effects (crying, regurgitation, vomiting) or on weight gain or length gain. CONCLUSION: Supplementing preterm formula with a mixture of galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides at a concentration of 10 g/l stimulates the growth of bifidobacteria in the intestine and results in stool characteristics similar to those found in preterm infants fed human milk. Therefore prebiotic mixtures such as the one studied may help to improve intestinal tolerance to enteral feeding in preterm infants.},

abstract = {Winemaking, brewing and baking are some of the oldest biotechnological processes. In all of them, alcoholic fermentation is the main biotransformation and Saccharomyces cerevisiae the primary microorganism. Although a wide variety of microbial species may participate in alcoholic fermentation and contribute to the sensory properties of end-products, the yeast S. cerevisiae invariably dominates the final stages of fermentation. The ability of S. cerevisiae to outcompete other microbial species during alcoholic fermentation processes, such as winemaking, has traditionally been ascribed to its high fermentative power and capacity to withstand the harsh environmental conditions, i.e. high levels of ethanol and organic acids, low pH values, scarce oxygen availability and depletion of certain nutrients. However, in recent years, several studies have raised evidence that S. cerevisiae, beyond its remarkable fitness for alcoholic fermentation, also uses defensive strategies mediated by different mechanisms, such as cell-to-cell contact and secretion of antimicrobial peptides, to combat other microorganisms. In this paper, we review the main physiological features underlying the special aptitude of S. cerevisiae for alcoholic fermentation and discuss the role of microbial interactions in its dominance during alcoholic fermentation, as well as its relevance for winemaking.},

abstract = {To maximize the production of carboxylic acids with open cultures of microbial consortia (reactor microbiomes), we performed experiments to understand which factors affect the community dynamics and performance parameters. We operated six thermophilic (55 °C) bioreactors to test how the factors: (i) biomass pretreatment; (ii) bioreactor operating conditions; and (iii) bioreactor history (after perturbations during the operating period) affected total fermentation product and n-butyrate performance parameters with corn fiber as the cellulosic biomass waste. We observed a maximum total fermentation product yield of 39{\%}, a n-butyrate yield of 23{\%} (both on a COD basis), a maximum total fermentation production rate of 0.74 g COD l(-1) d(-1) and n-butyrate production rate of 0.47 g COD l(-1) d(-1) in bioreactors that were fed with dilute-acid pretreated corn fiber at a pH of 5.5. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes with constrained ordination and other statistical methods showed that changes in operating conditions to enable dilution of toxic carboxylic acid products, which lead to these maximum performance parameters, also altered the composition of the microbiome, and that the microbiome, in turn, affected the performance. Operating conditions are an important factor (tool for operators) to shape reactor microbiomes, but other factors, such as substrate composition after biomass pretreatment and bioreactor history are also important. Further optimization of operating conditions must relieve the toxicity of carboxylic acids at acidic bioreactor pH levels even more, and this can, for example, be accomplished by extracting the product from the bioreactor solutions.},

abstract = {Phenotype instability of bacterial strains can cause significant problems in biotechnological applications, since industrially useful properties may be lost. Here we report such degenerative dissociation for Aneurinibacillus migulanus (formerly known as Bacillus brevis) an established producer of the antimicrobial peptide gramicidin S (GS). Phenotypic variations within and between various strains maintained in different culture collections are demonstrated. The type strain, ATCC 9999, consists of six colony morphology variants, R, RC, RP, RT, SC, and SP, which were isolated and characterized as pure cultures. Correlations between colony morphology, growth, GS production, spore formation, and resistance to their own antimicrobial peptide were established in this study. We found the original R form to be the best producer, followed by RC, RP, and RT, while SC and SP yielded no GS at all. Currently available ATCC 9999(T) contains only 2{\%} of the original R producer and is dominated by the newly described phenotypes RC and RP. No original R form is detected in the nominally equivalent strain DSM 2895(T) (=ATCC 9999(T)), which grows only as SC and SP phenotypes and has thus completely lost its value as a peptide producer. Two other strains from the same collection, DSM 5668 and DSM 5759, contain the unproductive SC variant and the GS-producing RC form, respectively. We describe the growth and maintenance conditions that stabilize certain colony phenotypes and reduce the degree of degenerative dissociation, thus providing a recommendation for how to revert the nonproducing smooth phenotypes to the valuable GS-producing rough ones.},

abstract = {Bacterial contamination during industrial yeast fermentation has serious economic consequences for fuel ethanol producers. In addition to deviating carbon away from ethanol formation, bacterial cells and their metabolites often have a detrimental effect on yeast fermentative performance. The bacterial contaminants are commonly lactic acid bacteria (LAB), comprising both homo- and heterofermentative strains. We have studied the effects of these two different types of bacteria upon yeast fermentative performance, particularly in connection with sugarcane-based fuel ethanol fermentation process. Homofermentative Lactobacillus plantarum was found to be more detrimental to an industrial yeast strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae CAT-1), when compared with heterofermentative Lactobacillus fermentum, in terms of reduced yeast viability and ethanol formation, presumably due to the higher titres of lactic acid in the growth medium. These effects were only noticed when bacteria and yeast were inoculated in equal cell numbers. However, when simulating industrial fuel ethanol conditions, as conducted in Brazil where high yeast cell densities and short fermentation time prevail, the heterofermentative strain was more deleterious than the homofermentative type, causing lower ethanol yield and out competing yeast cells during cell recycle. Yeast overproduction of glycerol was noticed only in the presence of the heterofermentative bacterium. Since the heterofermentative bacterium was shown to be more deleterious to yeast cells than the homofermentative strain, we believe our findings could stimulate the search for more strain-specific antimicrobial agents to treat bacterial contaminations during industrial ethanol fermentation.},

abstract = {The effect of four sugars (glucose, galactose, lactose and fructose) on exopolysaccharide (EPS) production by Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum CRC 002 was evaluated. More EPS was produced when CRC 002 was grown on lactose in the absence of pH control, with a production of 1080+/-120 mg EPS l(-1) (P{\textless}0.01) after 24 h of incubation. For fructose, galactose and glucose, EPS production was similar, at 512+/-63, 564+/-165 and 616+/-93 mg EPS l(-1), respectively. The proposed repeating unit composition of the EPS is 2 galactose to 3 glucose. The effect of sugar and fermentation time on expression of genes involved in sugar nucleotide production ( galK, galE1, galE2, galT1, galT2, galU, rmlA, rmlB1 and rmlCD) and the priming glycosyltransferase ( wblE) was quantified using real-time reverse transcription PCR. A significantly higher transcription level of wblE (9.29-fold) and the genes involved in the Leloir pathway (galK, 4.10-fold; galT1, 2.78-fold; and galE2, 4.95-fold) during exponential growth was associated with enhanced EPS production on lactose compared to glucose. However, galU expression, linking glucose metabolism with the Leloir pathway, was not correlated with EPS production on different sugars. Genes coding for dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis were also differentially expressed depending on sugar source and growth phase, although rhamnose was not present in the composition of the EPS. This precursor may be used in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis. These results contribute to understanding the changes in gene expression when different sugar substrates are catabolized by B. longum subsp. longum CRC 002.},

abstract = {During brewery handling, production strains of yeast must respond to fluctuations in dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, osmolarity, ethanol concentration, nutrient supply and temperature. Fermentation performance of brewing yeast strains is dependent on their ability to adapt to these changes, particularly during batch brewery fermentation which involves the recycling (repitching) of a single yeast culture (slurry) over a number of fermentations (generations). Modern practices, such as the use of high-gravity worts and preparation of dried yeast for use as an inoculum, have increased the magnitude of the stresses to which the cell is subjected. The ability of yeast to respond effectively to these conditions is essential not only for beer production but also for maintaining the fermentation fitness of yeast for use in subsequent fermentations. During brewery handling, cells inhabit a complex environment and our understanding of stress responses under such conditions is limited. The advent of techniques capable of determining genomic and proteomic changes within the cell is likely vastly to improve our knowledge of yeast stress responses during industrial brewery handling.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop an index that assesses the degree of adherence to existing diet-lifestyle recommendations for preschoolers (Preschoolers Diet-Lifestyle Index (PDL-Index)) and to investigate its association with obesity.

DESIGN: The PDL-Index was constructed using eleven components (i.e. questions regarding the frequency of consumption of selected foods/food groups, time spent on television watching and on moderate-to-vigorous physical activities).

SETTING: Scores from 0 to 4 were assigned to all components of the index. The PDL-Index total score ranged from 0 to 44. Higher values of the PDL-Index indicate greater adherence to dietary and lifestyle recommendations for preschoolers or otherwise greater adherence to healthier dietary-lifestyle patterns.

SUBJECTS: As a validation procedure, a sample of 2287 preschoolers from Greece (GENESIS study) was used.

RESULTS: The participants following healthier diet-lifestyle patterns (third tertile of PDL-Index) were less likely to be obese or overweight/obese compared to those following unhealthy diet-lifestyle patterns (first tertile of PDL-Index). It was observed that a 1/44 unit increase in the score of the PDL-Index was associated with approximately 5 {\%} and 3 {\%} lower odds of being obese and overweight/obese, respectively. Statistically significant results were observed after adjusting for potential confounders.

CONCLUSIONS: The suggested PDL-Index could help public health policy makers in identifying vulnerable population subgroups and developing cost-effective, targeted intervention actions both in family and preschool settings. In addition, health-care professionals can use the PDL-Index to evaluate diet quality, lifestyle and risk for overweight/obesity at an individual level and counsel parents accordingly.},

abstract = {This book is a contribution of the authors to the food - fuel debate. During 2007 and 2008 several factors led to the food inflation problem: growing population, income distribution, urbanization, biofuel, social programs, production scarcity etc. Biofuel got most of the blame for food inflation but its responsibility was only limited. There are several possibilities of solving the food inflation problem that are discussed this book. It explores the example of Brazil{\{}u2019{\}}s agricultural sector, where a quiet revolution occurred in the last 15 years. This development is leading to Brazil becoming one of the largest food exporters globally. This position will strengthen as an additional 100 million hectares becomes available for crop development. The second part of the book explores the basics of the sugar cane chain. Sugar cane occupies less than 2{\%} of Brazilian arable land and supplies 50{\%} of Brazilian car fuel. In 2010 Brazil produced 53{\%} of the world{\{}u2019{\}}s sugar. Sugar cane produces sugar, ethanol (used as car fuel), biogases that are used to co-generate electricity and other by-products. Biofuel is a booming industry. New technologies allow production of diesel and other fuels from cane. Sugar cane ethanol is the only renewable fuel that can currently compete with gasoline. Coca Cola just launched the plastic bottle with sugar cane plastic. This book helps us to understand Brazilian agribusiness and sugar cane economics from various perspectives e.g. international investments, sustainability, future trends and the strategic plan for the Brazilian industry. Introduction -- 1. The need for food and fuel production and the role of Brazilian agribusiness -- 2. The sugar-energy value chain in Brazil -- 3.

abstract = {The combined effects of lactic acid and acetic acid on ethanol production by S. cerevisiae in corn mash, as influenced by temperature, were examined. Duplicate full factorial experiments (three lactic acid concentrations x three acetic acid concentrations) were performed to evaluate the interaction between lactic and acetic acids on the ethanol production of yeast at each of the three temperatures, 30, 34, and 37 degrees C. Corn mash at 30{\%} dry solids adjusted to pH 4 after lactic and acetic acid addition was used as the substrate. Ethanol production rates and final ethanol concentrations decreased (P{\textless}0.001) progressively as the concentration of combined lactic and acetic acids in the corn mash increased and the temperature was raised from 30 to 37 degrees C. At 30 degrees C, essentially no ethanol was produced after 96 h when 0.5{\%} w/v acetic acid was present in the mash (with 0.5, 2, and 4{\%} w/v lactic acid). At 34 and 37 degrees C, the final concentrations of ethanol produced by the yeast were noticeably reduced by the presence of 0.3{\%} w/v acetic acid and {\textgreater}or=2{\%} w/v lactic acid. It can be concluded that, as in previous studies with defined media, lactic acid and acetic acid act synergistically to reduce ethanol production by yeast in corn mash. In addition, the inhibitory effects of combined lactic and acetic acid in corn mash were more apparent at elevated temperatures.},

abstract = {Urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) at a concentration of 30 to 32 mmol/liter reduced the numbers of five Lactobacillus spp. (Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paracasei, Lactobacillus sp. strain 3, L. rhamnosus, and L. fermentum) from approximately 10(7) to approximately 10(2) CFU/ml in a 2-h preincubation at 30 degrees C of normal-gravity wheat mash at approximately 21 g of dissolved solids per ml containing normal levels of suspended grain particles. Fermentation was completed 36 h after inoculation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of UHP, even when wheat mash was deliberately contaminated (infected) with L. paracasei at approximately 10(7) CFU/ml. There were no significant differences in the maximum ethanol produced between treatments when urea hydrogen peroxide was used to kill the bacteria and controls (in which no bacteria were added). However, the presence of L. paracasei at approximately 10(7) CFU/ml without added agent resulted in a 5.84{\%} reduction in the maximum ethanol produced compared to the control. The bactericidal activity of UHP is greatly affected by the presence of particulate matter. In fact, only 2 mmol of urea hydrogen peroxide per liter was required for disinfection when mashes had little or no particulate matter present. No significant differences were observed in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in normal-gravity wheat mash at 30 degrees C whether the bactericidal agent was added as H(2)O(2) or as urea hydrogen peroxide. NADH peroxidase activity (involved in degrading H(2)O(2)) increased significantly (P = 0.05) in the presence of 0.75 mM hydrogen peroxide (sublethal level) in all five strains of lactobacilli tested but did not persist in cells regrown in the absence of H(2)O(2). H(2)O(2)-resistant mutants were not expected or found when lethal levels of H(2)O(2) or UHP were used. Contaminating lactobacilli can be effectively managed by UHP, a compound which when used at ca. 30 mmol/liter happens to provide near-optimum levels of assimilable nitrogen and oxygen that aid in vigorous fermentation performance by yeast.},

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase alpha subunit (pheS) and the RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA) partial gene sequences for species identification of members of the genus Lactobacillus. Two hundred and one strains representing the 98 species and 17 subspecies were examined. The pheS gene sequence analysis provided an interspecies gap, which in most cases exceeded 10 {\%} divergence, and an intraspecies variation of up to 3 {\%}. The rpoA gene sequences revealed a somewhat lower resolution, with an interspecies gap normally exceeding 5 {\%} and an intraspecies variation of up to 2 {\%}. The combined use of pheS and rpoA gene sequences offers a reliable identification system for nearly all species of the genus Lactobacillus. The pheS and rpoA gene sequences provide a powerful tool for the detection of potential novel Lactobacillus species and synonymous taxa. In conclusion, the pheS and rpoA gene sequences can be used as alternative genomic markers to 16S rRNA gene sequences and have a higher discriminatory power for reliable identification of species of the genus Lactobacillus.},

Antimicrobials such as virginiamycin (VIR) and penicillin (PEN) are frequently used to control contamination but there are little data available on the susceptibility of bacterial contaminants to these agents. A survey of bacterial contaminants from a wet-mill ethanol plant with no history of using antibiotics and a dry-grind facility that periodically doses with VIR found that the majority of contaminants were species of Lactobacillus. Thirty-seven isolates of Lactobacillus species from the wet-mill and 42 isolates from the dry-grind facility were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using broth dilution and agar dilution methods. In general, the Lactobacillus isolates from the dry-grind plant had higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for the tested agents than the isolates from the wet-mill facility. The MIC(90) for VIR was 4 microg/ml for the dry-grind isolates versus 0.25 microg/ml for the wet-mill isolates; and for PEN, the MIC(90)'s were {\textgreater}8 and 2 microg/ml for the dry-grind and wet-mill isolates, respectively. Sixteen Lactobacillus isolates from the dry-grind plant but none from the wet-mill possessed vatE, a gene that encodes a streptogramin acetyltransferase associated with resistance to virginiamycin. Despite decreased susceptibility to virginiamycin, most dry-grind isolates had MICs lower than the maximal recommended application rate of 6 ppm.},

abstract = {The search for petroleum alternatives has motivated intense research into biological breakdown of lignocellulose to produce liquid fuels such as ethanol. Degradation of lignocellulose for biofuel production is a difficult process which is limited by, among other factors, the recalcitrance of lignocellulose and biological toxicity of the products. Consolidated bioprocessing has been suggested as an efficient and economical method of producing low value products from lignocellulose; however, it is not clear whether this would be accomplished more efficiently with a single organism or community of organisms. This review highlights examples of mixtures of microbes in the context of conceptual models for developing symbiotic consortia for biofuel production from lignocellulose. Engineering a symbiosis within consortia is a putative means of improving both process efficiency and stability relative to monoculture. Because microbes often interact and exist attached to surfaces, quorum sensing and biofilm formation are also discussed in terms of consortia development and stability. An engineered, symbiotic culture of multiple organisms may be a means of assembling a novel combination of metabolic capabilities that can efficiently produce biofuel from lignocellulose.},

Internal gains were therefore simulated using heated cylinders and heat losses using cooled surfaces. Evaluations were developed by means of experimental tests in an environmental chamber. Heat transfer coefficient may be expressed separately for radiation and convection or as one total parameter, but this choice may lead to different considerations about thermal performance of the system. In order to perform correct evaluations, it is therefore extremely important to use the proper reference temperature.

abstract = {Certain yeasts cause large-scale spoilage of preserved food materials, partly as a result of their ability to grow in the presence of the preservatives allowed in food and beverage preservation. This study used robotic methods to screen the collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion mutants for both increased sensitivity and increased resistance to sorbic acid, one of the most widely-used weak organic acid preservatives. In this way it sought to identify the non-essential, non-redundant activities that influence this resistance, activities that might be the potential targets of new preservation strategies. 237 mutants were identified as incapable of growth at pH 4.5 in presence of 2 mM sorbic acid, while 34 mutants exhibit even higher sorbate resistance than the wild-type parental strain. A number of oxidative stress-sensitive mutants, also mitochondrial mutants, are sorbate-sensitive. This appears to reflect the importance of sustaining a reducing intracellular environment (high reduced glutathione levels and NADH/NAD and NADPH/NADP ratios). Sorbate resistance is also very severely compromised in mutants lacking an acidified vacuole, in vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants, in mutants defective in ergosterol biosynthesis (erg mutants) and with several defects in actin and microtubule organization. Sorbate resistance is, however, elevated with the loss of the Yap5 transcription factor; with single losses of two B-type cyclins (Clb3p, Clb5p); and with loss of a plasma membrane calcium channel activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (Cch1p/Mid1p).},

abstract = {Traditionally, distilling companies in Scotland have employed a very limited number of yeast strains in the production of alcohol for Scotch whiskies. Recent changes such as the decline in availability of brewers yeast as a secondary yeast strain and the availability of yeast in different formats (e.g., dried and cream yeast as alternatives to compressed yeast) have promoted interest in alternative Scotch whisky distilling yeasts. In previous work, we investigated different strains of yeasts, specifically Brazilian yeasts which had been isolated from and used in fuel alcohol distilleries. One of the Brazilian yeasts (CAT 1) showed a comparable fermentation performance and superior stress tolerance compared with a standard commercial Scotch whisky distilling yeast (M Type). The Brazilian CAT 1 yeast isolate was further assessed in laboratory scale fermentations and subsequent new make spirit was subjected to sensory analyses. The spirits produced using the Brazilian strain had acceptable flavour profiles and exhibited no sensory characteristics that were atypical of Scotch whisky new make spirit. This study highlights the potential of exploiting yeast biodiversity in traditional Scotch whisky distillery fermentation processes.},

abstract = {Prebiotics are non-digestible substrates that stimulate the growth of beneficial microbial populations in the intestine, especially Bifidobacterium species. Among them, fructo- and galacto-oligosaccharides are commonly used in the food industry, especially as a supplement for infant formulas. Mechanistic details on the enrichment of bifidobacteria by these prebiotics are important to understand the effects of these dietary interventions. In this study the consumption of galactooligosaccharides was studied for 22 isolates of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, one of the most representative species in the infant gut microbiota. In general all isolates showed a vigorous growth on these oligosaccharides, but consumption of larger galactooligosaccharides was variable. Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697 has five genes encoding ??-galactosidases, and three of them were induced during bacterial growth on commercial galactooligosaccharides. Recombinant ??-galactosidases from B. infantis ATCC 15697 displayed different preferences for ??-galactosides such as 4' and 6'-galactobiose, and four ??-galactosidases in this strain released monosaccharides from galactooligosaccharides. Finally, we determined the amounts of short chain fatty acids produced by strain ATCC 15697 after growth on different prebiotics. We observed that biomass and product yields of substrate were higher for lactose and galactooligosaccharides, but the amount of acids produced per cell was larger after growth on human milk oligosaccharides. These results provide a molecular basis for galactooligosaccharide consumption in B. infantis, and also represent evidence for physiological differences in the metabolism of prebiotics that might have a differential impact on the host. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of cruciferous vegetables, such as, broccoli and cabbages, is associated with a reduced risk of developing cancer. This phenomenon has been attributed to specific glucosinolates among the {\~{}}30 glucosinolates that are typically present as natural products characteristic of cruciferous plants. Accordingly, there has been a strong interest to produce these compounds in microbial cell factories as it will allow production of selected beneficial glucosinolates. We have developed a versatile platform for stable expression of multi-gene pathways in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Introduction of the seven-step pathway of indolylglucosinolate from Arabidopsis thaliana to yeast resulted in the first successful production of glucosinolates in a microbial host. The production of indolylglucosinolate was further optimized by substituting supporting endogenous yeast activities with plant-derived enzymes. Production of indolylglucosinolate serves as a proof-of-concept for our expression platform, and provides a basis for large-scale microbial production of specific glucosinolates for the benefit of human health. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

@article{Hill1998,
abstract = {In Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, a number of cell wall- and cytoplasmic membrane-associated lipoproteins are induced in response to iron starvation. To gain insights into the molecular basis of iron-dependent gene regulation in the staphylococci, we sequenced the DNA upstream of the 3-kb S. epidermidis sitABC operon, which Northern blot analysis indicates is transcriptionally regulated by the growth medium iron content. We identified two DNA sequences which are homologous to elements of the Corynebacterium diphtheriae DtxR regulon, which controls, in response to iron stress, for example, production of diphtheria toxin, siderophore, and a heme oxygenase. Upstream of the sitABC operon and divergently transcribed lies a 645-bp open reading frame (ORF), which codes for a polypeptide of approximately 25 kDa with homology to the DtxR family of metal-dependent repressor proteins. This ORF has been designated SirR (staphylococcal iron regulator repressor). Within the sitABC promoter/operator region, we also located a region of dyad symmetry overlapping the transcriptional start of sitABC which shows high homology to the DtxR operator consensus sequence, suggesting that this region, termed the Sir box, is the SirR-binding site. The SirR protein was overexpressed, purified, and used in DNA mobility shift assays; SirR retarded the migration of a synthetic oligonucleotide based on the Sir box in a metal (Fe2+ or Mn2+)-dependent manner, providing confirmatory evidence that this motif is the SirR-binding site. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis of staphylococcal chromosomal DNA with the synthetic Sir box as a probe confirmed that there are at least five Sir boxes in the S. epidermidis genome and at least three in the genome of S. aureus, suggesting that SirR controls the expression of multiple target genes. Using a monospecific polyclonal antibody raised against SirR to probe Western blots of whole-cell lysates of S. aureus, S. carnosus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. cohnii, S. lugdunensis, and S. haemolyticus, we identified an approximately 25-kDa cross-reactive protein in each of the staphylococcal species examined. Taken together, these data suggest that SirR functions as a divalent metal cation-dependent transcriptional repressor which is widespread among the staphylococci.},

abstract = {The present study analyzes the lack of culturability of different non-Saccharomyces strains due to interaction with Saccharomyces cerevisiae during alcoholic fermentation. Interaction was followed in mixed fermentations with 1:1 inoculation of S. cerevisiae and ten non-Saccharomyces strains. Starmerella bacillaris and Torulaspora delbrueckii indicated longer coexistence in mixed fermentations compared with Hanseniaspora uvarum and Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Strain differences in culturability and nutrient consumption (glucose, alanine, ammonium, arginine or glutamine) were found within each species in mixed fermentation with S. cerevisiae. The interaction was further analyzed using cell-free supernatant from S. cerevisiae and synthetic media mimicking both single fermentations with S. cerevisiae and using mixed fermentations with the corresponding non-Saccharomyces species. Cell-free S. cerevisiae supernatants induced faster culturability loss than synthetic media corresponding to the same fermentation stage. This demonstrated that some metabolites produced by S. cerevisiae played the main role in the decreased culturability of the other non-Saccharomyces yeasts. However, changes in the concentrations of main metabolites had also an effect. Culturability differences were observed among species and strains in culture assays and thus showed distinct tolerance to S. cerevisiae metabolites and fermentation environment. Viability kit and recovery analyses on non-culturable cells verified the existence of viable but not-culturable status. These findings are discussed in the context of interaction between non-Saccharomyces and S. cerevisiae.},
